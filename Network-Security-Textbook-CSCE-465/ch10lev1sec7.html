<h3 id="title-IDA2HAEO" class="docSection1Title">10.7. Initial Password Distribution</h3>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1770"></a><a name="iddle1776"></a><a name="iddle1779"></a>Everything we've discussed so far describes how systems work once users have passwords and the systems know them. Another opportunity to get it wrong exists in the administrative procedures involved in getting to that state. After all, if you can impersonate the user to the system administrator, you can get the password by whatever mechanism the user could.</p>
<p class="docText">A secure method for the initial distribution of passwords is for the user to appear at the terminal of the system administrator and authenticate by whatever means humans use to authenticate (driver's license, student ID, birth certificate and two major credit cards, whatever). The system administrator then sets up all the particulars of the account for the user except the password (name, rights, quotas, choice of shell, ...) and then lets the user choose a password. This method has two drawbacks: it may be inconvenient for the user to meet the system administrator; and it's a little scary to let this new user type to this highly privileged terminal session while the system administrator discreetly looks away. A skilled user could probably do substantial damage in a short time. Even this problem could be circumvented by giving the user access to a special keyboard that only accepts passwords. This mechanism is sometimes used in special-case environments like establishing the <span class="docEmphRoman"><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_163">PIN</a></span> for an ATM. For a bank this is a sufficiently high-volume and security-sensitive application to justify special hardware.</p>
<p class="docText">Another variant on this theme is for the system administrator to create the account and an initial <span class="docEmphStrong">strong</span> (randomly chosen from a large space) password, give it to the user, and instruct the user to use the password only for an initial login and then change it to something more easily remembered. Some systems support the notion of <span class="docEmphStrong">pre-expired</span> passwords that require the user to change them as part of the login process. Even if the initial strong password is written down and the paper handed to a user, little security is lost because the password is no good after it is used and the user is likely to keep it safe that long.</p>
<p class="docText">In the name of convenience, there are weaker versions of this protocol. The administrator could set up the account and distribute the password by (paper) mail, in which case the security is as good as the security of mail. A common but insecure practice is to have the initial password be either a constant or an easily determined property of the user. A school might, for example, set all student passwords initially to their student IDs. Then they could communicate passwords to students with a broadcast (published) message rather than sending individualized notes. The security of this might be vaguely acceptable if the only thing a student account password protects is the work of the student, which is presumably nothing until the student uses the account for the first time. Even so, an attacker could log into the student's account ahead of time and plant Trojan horses.</p>
<p class="docText">The following story is true (or rather was told to me<sub>1</sub> as true by a person supposedly involved). Names are omitted to protect the guilty. See how many things you can find wrong with the way security was administered.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1104"></a><a name="iddle1529"></a>At a large commercial timesharing service bureau, security of privileged accounts (those that could access other users' data) was considered paramount. One of the security measures used to protect these accounts was that the passwords were randomly chosen and changed weekly. Every Sunday afternoon a batch job was run, selecting new random passwords and changing all the privileged accounts. Part of the batch job was to print a list of all the accounts and their passwords. This list was posted on a bulletin board so that as people came in Monday morning they could get their new passwords.</p>
<p class="docText">This worked fine until one Sunday the printer was broken. All the passwords were changed, but they weren't printed. Monday morning the printer was fixed, but no one could log in to request that the list be printed. In fact, no one could log in at all (except the commercial users, who saw no disruption). Some systems have a way to perform a privileged login given physical access to the machine, but this operating system didn'tÂit would support such an override only upon also erasing the disks, which by that time included unbacked-up commercial data. Many systems that do have such an override require that the system be rebooted in single-user mode, which would have been an unacceptable interruption of commercial service.</p>
<p class="docText">After thinking hard, some bright fellow noticed that the space from which the passwords were randomly selected was not unmanageably large, so they got all the people who couldn't do any work anyway (about 50) to repeatedly attempt logins to a single account with each of them assigned a range of passwords. By the end of the day Monday, one of them had succeeded and they were able to return to business as usual.</p>
