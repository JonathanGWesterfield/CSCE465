<h3 id="643999-826" class="docSection1Title">21.18. S/MIME Certificate Hierarchy</h3>
<p class="docText">An important reason why S/MIME succeeded while PEM failed is that S/MIME did not try to prescribe a particular public key infrastructure. An important side effect was that the security gained from using it is limited (though that could improve if a workable PKI gets deployed). There are several hierarchies people use with S/MIME.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDA2PB2H" class="docSection2Title">21.18.1. S/MIME with a Public Certifier</h4>
<p class="docText">Several companies, most notably Verisign and Thawte, have tried to make a business of issuing certificates to S/MIME users related to their businesses creating SSL certificates for public web servers. They have different levels of assurance with which users can be authenticated, where that assurance level is indicated in the certificates issued. Presumably, the certificates with a greater degree of assurance cost more, since the higher levels of assurance involve more administrative overhead.</p>
<p class="docText">Both companies have been fairly successful with their free certificates with low assurance that they issue as a loss leader to get people into the system.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDANQB2H" class="docSection2Title">21.18.2. S/MIME with an Organizational Certifier</h4>
<p class="docText">An alternative to getting certificates from a public certifier is to get them from an organization with which you have some affiliationÂtypically an employer. Several commercial mail products include CAs that allow certificate generation for their users. The challenge with non-public certifiers is getting the recipients' software to trust the issuer of the certificate. For mail sent within organizations, this can be done as a matter of configuration. Also within organizations, users' certificates can be listed in an organizational LDAP directory so that senders can look up recipients' public keys in order to send them encrypted mail.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAZQB2H" class="docSection2Title">21.18.3. S/MIME with Certificates from Any Old CA</h4>
<p class="docText">The way S/MIME is most frequently used is without a directory for storing certificates and without a need for trusted certifiers. If I want to send you encrypted mail, I first get you to send me signed mail. Your signed mail contains your certificate, which I accept into my personal address book and tell my system to trust. (If you have a certificate from a certifier I already trust, this is a little easier, but if not I just say &quot;OK&quot; to one more security warning that I don't understand.)</p>
<p class="docText">This mechanism for securing mail has many theoretical flaws. An attacker could impersonate us to one another or read or forge mail. But in practice, attackers do not yet have the technical sophistication to do these things. S/MIME used in this manner is very effective against passive eavesdropping, which is the attack most people worry about. Even the most sophisticated PKI can't protect you from someone breaking into your machine, stealing your keys, and reading your email that way, which is probably the most common attack in practice.</p>
