<blockquote>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Lions and tigers and bears, oh my</span>!</p>
<p class="docText">ÂDorothy (in the movie <span class="docEmphasis">The Wizard of Oz</span>)</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">People like to categorize different types of malicious software and assign them cute biological terms (if one is inclined to think of worms as cute). We don't think it's terribly important to distinguish between these things, but will define some of the terms that seem to be infecting the literature.</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList"><b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_229">Trojan horse</a></b>Âinstructions hidden inside an otherwise useful program that do bad things. Usually the term Trojan horse is used when the malicious instructions are installed at the time the program is written (and the term <i><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_240">virus</a></i> is used if the instructions get added to the program later).</p></li><li><p class="docList"><b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_240">virus</a></b>Âa set of instructions that, when executed, inserts copies of itself into other programs. More recently, the term has been applied to instructions in email messages that, when executed, cause the malicious code to be sent in email to other users.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_245">worm</a></b>Âa program that replicates itself by installing copies of itself on other machines across a network.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><a name="iddle1269"></a><a name="iddle1574"></a><a name="iddle2092"></a><a name="iddle2147"></a><span class="docEmphStrong">trapdoor</span>Âan undocumented entry point intentionally written into a program, often for debugging purposes, which can be exploited as a security flaw.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_123">logic bomb</a></b>Âmalicious instructions that trigger on some event in the future, such as a particular time occurring.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphStrong">zombie</span>Âmalicious instructions installed on a system that can be remotely triggered to carry out some attack with less traceability because the attack comes from another victim. Often the attacker installs large numbers of zombies in order to be able to generate large bursts of network traffic.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">We do not think it's useful to take these categories seriously. As with most categorizations (e.g., plants vs. animals, intelligence vs. instinct), there are things that don't fit neatly within these categories. So we'll refer to all kinds of malicious software generically as <span class="docEmphStrong">digital pests</span>.</p>
<a name="ch01lev2sec9"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAAETRE" class="docSection2Title">1.12.1. Where Do They Come From?</h4>
<p class="docText">Where do these nasties come from? Except for trapdoors, which may be intentionally installed to facilitate troubleshooting, they are written by bad guys with nothing better to do with their lives than annoy people.</p>
<p class="docText">How could an implementer get away with writing a digital pest into a program? Wouldn't someone notice by looking at the program? One of the most famous results in computer science is that it is provably impossible to be able to tell what an arbitrary program will do by looking at it<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#ch01fn01">[*]</a></sup>, so certainly it would be impossible to tell, in general, whether the program had any unpleasant side effects besides its intended purpose. But that's not the real problem. The real problem is that nobody looks. Often when you buy a program you do not have access to the source code, and even if you did, you probably wouldn't bother reading it all, or reading it very carefully. Many programs that run have never been reviewed by anybody. A major advantage offered by the &quot;open source&quot; movement (where all software is made available in source code format) is that even if you don't review it carefully, there is a better chance that someone else will.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="ch01fn01">[*]</a></sup> This is known in the literature as <span class="docEmphasis">the halting problem</span>, which states that it is impossible in general to tell whether a given program will halt or not. In fact it is impossible in general to discern any nontrivial property of a program.</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">What does a virus look like? A virus can be installed in just about any program by doing the following:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">replace any instruction, say the instruction at location <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>, by a jump to some free place in memory, say location <span class="docEmphasis">y</span>; then</p></li><li><p class="docList">write the virus program starting at location <span class="docEmphasis">y</span>; then</p></li><li><p class="docList"><a name="iddle1183"></a><a name="iddle1806"></a><a name="iddle1836"></a>place the instruction that was originally at location <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> at the end of the virus program, followed by a jump to <span class="docEmphasis">x</span>+1.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">Besides doing whatever damage the virus program does, it might replicate itself by looking for any executable files in any directory and infecting them. Once an infected program is run, the virus is executed again, to do more damage and to replicate itself to more programs. Most viruses spread silently until some triggering event causes them to wake up and do their dastardly deeds. If they did their dastardly deeds all the time, they wouldn't spread as far.</p>
<p class="docText">How does a digital pest originally appear on your computer? All it takes is running a single infected program. A program posted on a bulletin board might certainly be infected. But even a program bought legitimately might conceivably have a digital pest. It might have been planted by a disgruntled employee or a saboteur who had broken into the computers of the company and installed the pest into the software before it was shipped. There have been cases where commercial programs were infected because some employee ran a program gotten from a friend or a bulletin board.</p>
<p class="docText">Often at holiday times people send email messages with attached programs and instructions to run them. While this used to require extracting the email message to a file and possibly processing it first, modern email systems make it very convenient to run such things... often just by clicking on an icon in the message. Often the result is some sort of cute holiday-specific thing, like displaying a picture of a turkey or playing a Christmas carol. It could certainly also contain a virus. Few people will scan the program before running it, especially if the message arrives from a friend. And if you were to run such a program and it did something cute, you might very well forward it to a friend, not realizing that in addition to doing the cute thing it might very well have installed a virus that will start destroying your directory a week after the virus is first run. A good example of a Christmas card email message is a program written by Ian Phillipps, which was a winner of the 1988 International Obfuscated C Code Contest. It is delightful as a Christmas card. It does nothing other than its intended purpose (I<sub>1</sub> have analyzed the thing carefully and I<sub>2</sub> have complete faith in me<sub>1</sub>), but we doubt many people would take the time to understand this program before running it (see <a class="docLink" href="#ch01tab02">Figure 1-4</a>).</p>

<p class="docText">Sometimes you don't realize you're running a program. <span class="docEmphRoman"><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_168">PostScript</a></span> is a complete programming language. It is possible to embed a Trojan horse into a PostScript file that infects files with viruses and does other damage. Someone could send you a file and tell you to display it. You wouldn't realize you were running a program by merely displaying the file. And if there was any hope of scanning a C program to find suspicious instructions, there are very few people who could scan a PostScript file and look for suspicious PostScript commands. PostScript is, for all practical purposes, a write-only language.</p>
<p class="docText">As mail systems get more clever in their attempt to make things more convenient for users, the risk becomes greater.

<p class="docText">If you wanted to display the file, you'd have to extract the mail message and send it to the printer, or input it into a special program that displays PostScript on your screen. However, a clever mail program might look at the message, recognize that it was PostScript, and automatically run the PostScript code to display the message. Although this is convenient, it is dangerous.</p>
<p class="docText">There are various other clever features being added to mail programs. Some mail programs allow the sender to send a program along with the mail message. Usually the mail message will arrive and display some sort of icon. If the receiver clicks on the icon, the transmitted program is executed. Someone, to illustrate this point, sent such a mail message. It displayed only as a button that said <span class="docEmphasis">push me</span>. When the person who received the message clicked on the box, it came up with a message that said, <span class="docEmphasis">I could have just reformatted your hard drive</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">In the first edition of this book, we said &quot;Before the technology for clever mail goes much further, we ought to consider how we can reap the benefits of such cleverness while minimizing the security risks&quot;. We can now confidently say that it has gone much further, no one has worried at all about security, and as anyone who has been stung by the email virus of the week can attest, the situation is a disaster.</p>
<p class="docText">There remain dangers associated with booting from floppy disks. If the hard drive of a computer were completely wiped clean, there has to be some way to come up again, so machines provide the feature that if there is a floppy in the drive when the machine is powered on, the machine boots off the floppy. This can be disabled, but it rarely is. Even if system software becomes sophisticated about security, it won't be able to protect against Trojan horses on the boot device. When you turn on many machines with a floppy disk inserted into the drive (intentionally or accidentally), they execute the code on the floppy in a privileged mode. If there is a virus in that code, it can infect the system.</p>
<p class="docText">Most PCs are configured to detect a CD-ROM placed in the drive and will execute a startup program automatically when a new one is inserted. This may have been a relatively safe thing to do when writable CD-Rs were a rarity and most CD-ROMs were commercially manufactured, but today it is likely viruses will spread this way. With CD-RWs becoming common, viruses can spread across your CDs the way they once did across floppies.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAVNTRE" class="docSection2Title">1.12.2. Spreading Pests from Machine to Machine</h4>
<p class="docText">How might a virus or worm spread from machine to machine? An infected program might be copied to a floppy or other medium and moved to another machine. Or, as we said, a mail message might carry the infection. But it is also possible for the pest to explore the network and send itself to other machines, once it is running in one machine on a network. Such a pest is called a worm.</p>
<p class="docText">One method a worm can employ to transmit itself to another machine is to actually log into the other machine. It can do this by guessing passwords. Sometimes things are set up to make it really easy; for instance, account name/password pairs might be stored in script files so that a naive user can access remote resources automatically. If the worm manages to find that information, it can easily log into other machines and install itself. Sometimes machines have trapdoor debugging features, such as the ability to run a command remotely. Sometimes it isn't even necessary to log in to run such a command. And if intruders can execute commands, they can do anything.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">The only reason all the computers in the world haven't crashed at the same time is that they're not all connected together yet.</span></p>
<p class="docText">ÂDave Cheriton</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1456"></a><a name="iddle1830"></a><a name="iddle2126"></a>In the first widely publicized example, a Christmas-card-type email message displayed a pretty animated tree on the screen, but also scanned the user's directory for all possible correspondents, including distribution lists, and mailed itself to them. Each time a recipient read a copy of the message, it sprang into life and mailed itself off to all the mailboxes it could locate from that node. This was written by someone who was not trying to attack systemsÂhe was just trying to be &quot;cute&quot; but didn't consider the likely consequences of his action. Although this program did not destroy data, like a classic worm it completely overloaded and disabled the corporation's electronic mail.</p>
<p class="docText">Email borne viruses have become the most common kind in the last few years, taking advantage both of bugs in email systems and naive users. The &quot;ILoveYou&quot; virus was particularly virulent because users were willing to take a chance and run the attachment when the message had a seductive subject line.</p>
<p class="docText">Worms have also become more effective at spreading as more machines are continuously connected to the Internet via cable modems and DSL, but not carefully configured for security. In several cases, insecure default configurations or bugs in services that were enabled by default provided fertile ground for worms to spread.</p>
<a name="ch01lev2sec11"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAIPTRE" class="docSection2Title">1.12.3. Virus Checkers</h4>
<p class="docText">How can a program check for viruses? There's rather a race between the brave and gallant people who analyze the viruses and write clever programs to detect and eliminate them, and the foul-smelling scum who devise new types of viruses that will escape detection by all the current virus checkers.</p>
<p class="docText">The most common form of virus checker knows the instruction sequence for lots of types of viruses, checks all the files on disk and instructions in memory for those patterns of commands, and raises a warning if it finds a match hidden somewhere inside some file. Once you own such a virus checker, you need to periodically get updates of the patterns file that includes the newest viruses. To evade detection of their viruses, virus creators have devised what is known as a <span class="docEmphStrong">polymorphic virus</span> which changes the order of its instructions, or changes to functionally similar instructions, each time it copies itself. Such a virus may still be detectable, but it takes more work and typically requires a coding change and not just a new pattern file. Modern virus checkers don't just periodically scan the disk. They actually hook into the operating system and inspect files before they are written to disk.</p>
<p class="docText">Another type of virus checker takes a snapshot of disk storage by recording the information in the directories, such as file lengths. It might even take message digests of the files. It is designed to run, store the information, and then run again at a future time. It will warn you if there are suspicious changes. One virus, wary of changing the length of a file by adding itself to the program, compressed the program so that the infected program would wind up being the same length as the original. When the program was executed, the uncompressed portion containing the virus decompressed the rest of the program, so (other than the virus portion) the program could run normally.</p>
<p class="docText">It would be natural for viruses to attack the virus checkers rather than just trying to elude them. One could even imagine a virus spread by the mechanism a virus checker uses to keep its pattern files up to date. Such a virus has not been seen at the time of this writing, but it is something to look forward to.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAFQTRE" class="docSection2Title">1.12.4. What Can We Do Today?</h4>
<p class="docText">The world was a scary place before computer viruses came along, and will most likely continue to be scary. How can you know whether you can trust a program not to do bad things when you run it? Wouldn't it be nice to have the equivalent of a lie-detector test for programs?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Ames slipped by a lie-detector test because no one had told the polygrapher he was under suspicion.</span></p>
<p class="docText">ÂDouglas Waller &amp; Evan Thomas <span class="docEmphasis">Newsweek</span> article on CIA and traitor Aldrich Ames, October 10, 1994</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Given that there is no infallible method to test a program for hidden bad side effects, we can't be completely safe, but there are some precautions that are worth taking:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Don't run software from suspicious sources, like bulletin boards or people who aren't as careful as you are.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Frequently run virus checkers. Have the industry employ people whose job it is to keep up with virus technology and come up with vaccines.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Try to run programs in the most limited possible environments. For instance, if you have a <span class="docEmphRoman"><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_159">PC</a></span> in order to get real work done, and you also want to play games, sometimes using shareware or games copied from bulletin boards, have two machines. If you run a game with a virus, you'll only wipe out your games. A somewhat more practical way to accomplish this is to have a machine with multiple disks and a physical switch that connects only one of them at a time.</p></li><li><p class="docList">When your system puts up a warning saying that something is dangerous, don't do it!</p></li><li><p class="docList">Do frequent backups, and save old backups for a long time.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Don't boot off floppies, except in an extreme circumstance, such as the first time you unpack your machine and turn it on. In those circumstances, be extremely careful about what floppy you boot from.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">But mostly, the situation is pretty bleak, given the design of the operating systems for PCs. Maybe in the future, some of our suggestions in the next section might be implemented.</p>
<a name="ch01lev2sec13"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAFSTRE" class="docSection2Title">1.12.5. Wish List for the Future</h4>
<p class="docText">I<sub>2</sub> always assumed computers were designed in such a way that no program that ran on the machine could possibly injure the machine. Likewise, it should not be possible to send a piece of information to a machine that might damage the machine. People are designed properly that way, aren't they?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">(chant designed to encourage bullies to get physical)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">But one of my<sub>2</sub> first programs consisted of something that just sat around and waited for interrupts, and processed the interrupts. The program itself, not counting the instructions for processing the interrupts, was <span class="docEmphStrong"><tt>HERE: JUMP HERE</tt></span> (that's not the exact instruction, because I<sub>2</sub> don't want to divulge the brand of computer). I<sub>2</sub> discovered (the hard way) that you weren't supposed to do that, because it burned out core at the instruction that kept getting executed over and over. Gerry Sussman, while a high school student, wrote a program that broke magnetic tapes. The guru who guarded and ran the mainframe didn't believe Gerry when he boasted that he could write a program to break tapes, so Gerry wrote his program to go down the entire row of tape drives, breaking the tape in each one. Another example was a machine designed with a small amount of <span class="docEmphRoman"><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_141">nonvolatile memory</a></span>, but the type that wore out after a finite number of writes, say 10000. That kind of memory is fine for something like saving terminal settings, since a human has to type the key sequence to cause a write, and a human won't do it very often. But if the same kind of memory is used for storing parameter settings received by a network management message, then it is possible to break the machine within seconds by sending it parameter settings over and over.</p>
<p class="docText">In an ideal world, it should be possible to load a floppy and examine the contents without fear. You should be able to receive any email message without fear. If it is a multimedia message, it should be possible to play the audio, display the video, print the text, or waft the odors without damage to either the machine or files stored on the machine. A file is just a bunch of bits. If the file claims to be audio, it should be possible, without risk of any type of harm, to play the file. Likewise, if the file claims to be something worthy of printing, it should not cause any harm to print the file.</p>
<p class="docText">Programs are a bit trickier. It should be possible to run a program and have confidence that it will not affect the files stored on your machine or the basic integrity of the operating system.</p>
<p class="docText">We know none of these &quot;shoulds&quot; are true today. The files on your machine can be virus-infected through email, by displaying a PostScript file, or simply by inserting a floppy disk or CD-ROM (on some machines). How could systems be designed more defensively?</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1668"></a>One simple feature would be a write-protect switch on your hard disk. Sometimes you run programs that you know should not be writing to your hard disk. A game program shouldn't be writing to your hard disk. Perhaps it wants to record highest score, but consumers might be willing to do without that frill if it means that they can run any game they want without fear of wiping out their life's work. Legitimate game manufacturers could design their games to work with write-protected hard disks. There is still the risk that the social misfits who design games that spread viruses could design their games to work with write-protected hard disks, but have their program check to see if some user has forgotten to write-protect the disk, and then launch the virus.</p>
<p class="docText">Timesharing systems used to be much more defensive. You could not run a program that would write into some other user's memory, or modify any portion of the disk that you were not authorized to write into. But PCs make the assumption that there is only one human on the machine at a time, and that human ought to be able to do anything it wants. To make matters worse, to enable snazzy maximally flexible features, there are all sorts of surprising places where someone can insert a program that will be executed.</p>
<p class="docText">The operating system ought to be built more defensively. PCs should have accounts just like timesharing systems so that you can set up a game account that can't affect the rest of the system. Likewise, your normal account shouldn't be able to alter system software. You should be able to easily run a program with the right to access only a single directory (its own). The world is moving in this direction, but progress is slow.</p>
