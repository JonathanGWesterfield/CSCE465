<h3 id="title-IDAV3VGV" class="docSection1Title">26.21. Overestimate the Size of Key</h3>
<p class="docText">U.S. law enforcement was always trying to find the &quot;right&quot; key size, big enough to be &quot;secure enough&quot; but small enough that it would be breakable, if necessary, by law enforcement. Of course, such a key size couldn't be really secure, because &quot;secure&quot; means nobody, including them, would be able to break it. Anyway, the assumption was that they were smarter, or had more computation power, than the bad guys from whom you were trying to protect yourself. Even if that were true (e.g., that law enforcement had ten times as much computation power as organized crime), given that computers keep getting faster and encrypted data often needs to be protected for many years, something breakable by law enforcement today would be breakable by organized crime in a few years. But it's also absurd to assume that the bad guys (whoever they are) would have significantly less computation power at their disposal than law enforcement. So it's dangerous to try to pick the smallest &quot;sufficiently secure&quot; key size. It's better to pick the largest you are willing to live with in terms of performance, or pick the size that you think is definitely going to be secure for ten years and double it just to be safe. This practice also makes it less likely that in a few years you'll have to go through the annoyance of reconfiguring everything to use larger keys.</p>
