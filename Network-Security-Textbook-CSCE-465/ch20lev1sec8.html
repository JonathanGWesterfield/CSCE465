<h3 id="title-IDAG4XWC" class="docSection1Title">20.8. Non-Repudiation</h3>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1709"></a><a name="iddle1828"></a><a name="iddle1909"></a><b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_185">Repudiation</a></b> is the act of denying that you sent a message. If the message system provides for <b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_140">non-repudiation</a></b>, it means that if Alice sends a message to Bob, Alice cannot later deny that she sent the message. Bob can prove to a third party that Alice did indeed send the message. For instance, if Alice sends a message to the bank that she wishes to transfer a million dollars to Bob's account, the bank might not honor the transaction unless it is sent in such a way that not only can the bank know the message was from Alice, but they can prove it to a court if necessary.</p>
<p class="docText">It is not always desirable to have non-repudiation. For instance, Alice might be the head of some large organization and want to give the go-ahead to her underlings for some scheme like, say, selling arms to Iran to raise money to fund the Contras. The underlings must be absolutely certain the orders came from Alice, so it is necessary to have source authentication of the message, but Alice wants plausible deniability (what a great phrase!), so that if any of her underlings are caught or killed, she can disavow any knowledge of their actions.</p>
<p class="docText">With public keys, it is very natural to provide non-repudiable source authentication, and more difficult to provide repudiable source authentication. With secret keys, it is very natural to provide repudiable source authentication and very difficult to provide non-repudiable messages.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAZ5XWC" class="docSection2Title">20.8.1. Non-Repudiation Based on Public Key Technology</h4>
<p class="docText">The usual method Alice uses to prove the authenticity of her message to Bob is to include her public key signature on the message digest of the message, using her private key. This method of source authentication not only reassures Bob that Alice sent the message, but Bob can prove to anyone else that Alice sent the message. Only someone with knowledge of Alice's private key could have signed the message digest with it. But anyone knowing her public key can verify her signature.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAIIEZI" class="docSection2Title">20.8.2. Plausible Deniability Based on Public Key Technology</h4>
<p class="docText">How can Alice send a message to Bob in such a way that Bob knows it came from Alice, but Bob can't prove to anyone else that it came from Alice? Alice can send a public key based repudiable message <span class="docEmphasis">m</span> to Bob by doing the following.</p>
<p class="docText">First we'll review our notation. We use curly braces {} for encrypting something with a public key, with a subscript specifying the name of the individual whose public key we are using. We use square brackets [] for signing something with a private key, with a subscript specifying the name of the individual whose private key is being used.</p>

<p class="docText">Bob will know that the message came from Alice, because Alice signed the encrypted <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>. But Bob can't prove to anyone else that Alice sent him <span class="docEmphasis">m</span>. He can prove that at some point Alice sent some message using key <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>, but it might not have been <span class="docEmphasis">m</span>. Once Bob has the quantity [{<span class="docEmphasis">S</span>}<sub>Bob</sub>]<sub>Alice</sub> he can construct any message he likes and construct an integrity code using <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAULEZI" class="docSection2Title">20.8.3. Non-Repudiation with Secret Keys</h4>
<p class="docText">It is surprising that it is possible to provide non-repudiation with secret keys. Let's say Alice is sending a message to Bob, and it has to be possible for Bob to prove later, to &quot;the judge&quot;, that Alice sent the message. We'll need a notary <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> who must be trusted by Bob and the judge. (A <span class="docEmphStrong">notary</span> is a trusted service that vouches for certain information.) Alice sends the message to <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>, and does source authentication with <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> so that <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> knows the message came from Alice. <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> does some computation on the message and Alice's name using a secret quantity <span class="docEmphasis">S<sub>N</sub></span> that <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> shares with nobody. We'll call the result of this computation <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>'s <span class="docEmphStrong">seal</span> on the message. (For instance <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>'s seal might be the message digest of the concatenation of <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Alice</span>, the message, and <span class="docEmphasis">S<sub>N</sub></span>.) Then the message together with the seal is sent to Bob. Bob can't tell whether <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>'s seal is genuine, because that would require knowing <span class="docEmphasis">S<sub>N</sub></span>(which <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> shares with nobody). If Alice were dishonest and wanted to send a message to Bob that Bob would only accept if it were non-repudiable, then Alice could put in any cybercrud and pretend that it is authentication information from <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">There are two things we can do to assure Bob that the message was vouched for by <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>, and that therefore he can later prove to the judge that <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> vouched for the message.</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Bob and <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> could establish a shared key, and <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> could use it to generate a MAC for the concatenation of <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Alice</span>, the message, and the seal. Bob can verify this MAC (since he knows the shared key) and thus verify the validity of the seal.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Bob could, after receiving the message, send a request to <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> asking <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> if <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>'s seal is genuine. This request would of course have to include <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Alice</span>, the message, and the alleged seal.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1165"></a><a name="iddle1860"></a><a name="iddle1862"></a><a name="iddle1912"></a>Now let's assume at some later time Bob needs to prove to the judge that Alice sent the message. Bob sends <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Alice</span>, the message, and the seal to the judge, who sends it to <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> in an integrity-protected conversation. <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> verifies the validity of the seal and reports that to the judge.</p>
<p class="docText">Note that <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> does not actually have to see the message, in case Alice and Bob want to keep the message private. Alice could instead just send the message digest to <span class="docEmphasis">N</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">N</span> could compute the seal of the message digest.</p>
