<h3 id="title-IDAGQS4H" class="docSection1Title">9.5. Passwords as Cryptographic Keys</h3>
<p class="docText">Cryptographic keys, especially public key based cryptographic keys, are specially chosen very large numbers. A normal person would not be able to remember such a quantity. But a person can remember a password. It is possible to convert a text string memorizable by a human into a cryptographic key. For instance, to form a DES secret key, a possible transformation of the user's password is to do a cryptographic hash of the password and take 56 bits of the result. It is much more tricky (and computationally expensive) to convert a password into something like an RSA private key, since an RSA key has to be a carefully constructed number.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1306"></a><a name="iddle1952"></a><a name="iddle1977"></a>Jeff Schiller proposed a method of converting a password into an RSA key pair that has plausible efficiency. The basic idea is to convert the user's password into a seed for a random number generator. Choosing an RSA key pair involves testing a lot of randomly chosen numbers for primality to obtain two primes. And the primality tests involve choosing random numbers with which to test the randomly chosen primes. If the RSA key pair generator is run twice, and if for each run the sequence of the random numbers selected by the random number generator is the same, the RSA key pair generator will find the same RSA key pair. So if the user's password is the seed for the random number generator, the RSA key pair generator will always generate the same RSA key pair for the user.</p>
<p class="docText">Running the RSA key pair generator from the beginning, seeded with the user's password, is likely to take an unacceptable amount of computation, since typically the RSA key generator will find many non-primes before it finally finds two primes. If it had to be done every time the user logged in, it would be prohibitively expensive. But after the workstation successfully finds the RSA key pair derived from the user's password, it can give the user something to remember that would enable it to complete its work more quickly. For example, if (starting with the user's password as seed) the first prime was found after 857 guesses and the second after 533 guesses, then the user might be told to remember &lt;857, 533&gt;. It is an interesting problem to come up with a scheme that minimizes the amount of information the user needs to remember while still significantly lowering the work necessary for the computer. Note that since the &lt;857, 533&gt; quantity is not particularly security-sensitive, it could be posted on the user's workstation without significant loss of security.</p>
<p class="docText">Schemes based on this idea (direct conversion of the user's password to a public key pair) are not used because they perform poorly and because knowledge of the public key alone gives enough information for an off-line password-guessing attack. So the usual practice when using public keys with humans is to encrypt the user's private key with the user's password and store it somewhere (e.g., the directory service) from which it can be retrieved by the user's workstation and decrypted. In order for Alice's workstation, on behalf of Alice, to prove Alice's identity, it must first retrieve her encrypted private key from the directory service. Then it takes the password as typed by Alice, converts it into a secret key, and uses that secret key to decrypt the encrypted private key. There are clever schemes for doing this described in &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch12lev1sec4.html#ch12lev1sec4">12.4</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Strong Password Credentials Download Protocols</span>.</p>
