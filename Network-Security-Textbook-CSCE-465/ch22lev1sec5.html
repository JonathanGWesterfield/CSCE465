<h3 id="title-IDAZBY0F" class="docSection1Title">22.5. Certificate and Key Revocation</h3>
<p class="docText">A certificate can be revoked by whoever signed the certificate. It does not necessarily mean that the key in the certificate is bad; it just means that whoever signed the certificate no longer wants to vouch for its authenticity. Given that anyone can issue a certificate for anyone, and then issue a revocation of the certificate, having a revoked certificate does not necessarily mean anything bad about the individual certified. Otherwise, an enemy of yours could issue a certificate for you and then immediately revoke it, making everyone suspicious of you. (The reasoning might be: Why was the certificate revoked? Must be because the person had lied or something...) If a certificate is revoked, then whoever was relying on that certificate to authenticate you will no longer be able to authenticate you.</p>
<p class="docText">Certificates can optionally have a validity period, in which case they expire after the specified time period. They can be renewed by being reissued. The current custom in PGP is to issue non-expiring certificates (by omitting the <span class="docEmphSmaller">VALIDITY PERIOD</span> field).</p>
<p class="docText">Keys can be revoked too. My key can only be revoked by me (or someone who stole my private keyÂbut gee, if the bad guy is so obliging as to tell the world he stole my key, I'm not worried about him forging a key revocation for my key). The idea is that I will issue a key revocation only when I think someone has discovered my private key. I'll presumably generate a new key for myself, and distribute the key revocation for the old key as widely as possible (perhaps by publishing it in <span class="docEmphasis">The New York Times</span> as a legal notice).</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1855"></a><a name="iddle1999"></a>Key and certificate revocations are distributed informally, just as are public keys and certificates. There are public servers where you can post and search for certificates. A ritual has developed for populating those servers. Frequently, at gatherings of nerds, there is a PGP key signing &quot;party&quot;. People stand and state their name and public key fingerprint. People who know that person are encouraged to issue certificates for them. If you go to enough of these events, you're likely to get certificates from enough people that members of the community will be able to trust your key.</p>
