<h3 id="title-IDAKDLN" class="docSection1Title">9.9. Delegation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">It's not who you are. It's who you're working for.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="docText">Sometimes it is necessary to have things act on your behalf. For instance, you might be logged into system Bob, and then need to access remote files from Bob. In that case, Bob will need to retrieve the files on your behalf, and will need to have the same privileges for those files as you have. Similarly <a name="iddle1008"></a><a name="iddle1247"></a>you might tell a printserver to print a remote file that you are authorized to read. You could allow the required access by explicitly being available to log in to each resource that is ever needed on your behalf. That would be inconvenient at best, and sometimes impossible, for instance when you run a <span class="docEmphRoman"><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_018">batch job</a></span> when you aren't around.</p>
<p class="docText">One possible means of allowing access is to give your password to everything that might need to act on your behalf (printservers, foreign systems). This might be reasonable if you changed your password immediately after the work was completed. But most users would not change their password that frequently. Another possibility is that you could explicitly add every system to every ACL for every resource that they need to access on your behalf, and then, if you are conscientious, delete them from the ACL when the operation completes. These mechanisms are far too inconvenient, and most users would opt for no security at all if that was the alternative. Therefore it is advisable to have some more convenient mechanism for giving something permission to act on your behalf. This permission is known as <b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_069">delegation</a></b> or <span class="docEmphStrong">authentication forwarding</span>. The best mechanism for delegation in a computer network is to generate a special message, signed by you, specifying to whom you are delegating rights, which rights are being delegated, and for how long. Once the duration specified in the message has expired, the message no longer grants any permissions.</p>
<p class="docText">Using public key cryptography, the usual approach is for you to sign the delegation message with your own private key. Using KDCs, the usual approach is for you to ask the KDC to give Fred certain permissions. The KDC constructs a message listing the permissions you'd like to grant Fred, encrypts the message with a key known only to the KDC, and Fred is given the encrypted message. Fred cannot decrypt the message, but he can present it to the KDC when asking for access; the KDC can decrypt it and then see the rights that have been delegated to Fred.</p>
<p class="docText">Why is it necessary for the delegation message to expire? If you are delegating rights to a printserver and it can be trusted for the hour it takes to finish printing all the documents ahead of yours, and then print your document, can't it always be trusted? If it were untrustworthy, surely it could have retrieved all your documents during the one hour in which you gave it access rights to your files. In theory this argument is true. You can't necessarily know that the printserver hasn't had some Trojan horse software installed which will steal all your files during the limited time you give it access, but limiting the delegation in time limits the window of vulnerability. You can further limit the vulnerability by limiting the scope of the delegation. Instead of specifying that the printserver has rights to see all your files, you might specify only the single file that you'd like printed.</p>
<p class="docText">The need for delegation in some form is generally recognized, and various systems implement crude forms of it. However, designing a user interface and corresponding data structure where a user specifies what rights are delegated and to whom is an open research problem.</p>
