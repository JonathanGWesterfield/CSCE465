<h3 id="643999-845" class="docSection1Title">20.7. Message Integrity</h3>
<p class="docText">When Bob receives a message from Alice, how does he know that Carol did not intercept the message and modify it? For instance, she might have changed the message <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Fire Carol immediately</span> to <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Promote Carol immediately.</span></p>
<p class="docText">It makes little sense to provide for authentication of the source without also guaranteeing integrity of the contents of the message. Who would care that the message originated with Alice, if the contents might have been modified en route? Indeed, all of the mail standards provide message integrity and source authentication together. They either provide both or neither. The mechanisms discussed in the previous section for source authentication provide message integrity as well.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDANOCEK" class="docSection2Title">20.7.1. Message Integrity without Source Authentication</h4>
<p class="docText">Might someone want to provide message integrity protection without source authentication? The only vaguely plausible example we could come up with for when this might be useful was a ransom note. The kidnappers would want to prove that they were the kidnappers, perhaps by extracting some secret information from the victim. The note would give the proof that they were the kidnappers, and include directions for dropping off the ransom money. They'd want to keep the message private, since they wouldn't want someone else to get that secret, convince the family they were the kidnappers, and collect the ransom. Nor would they want some third party to see the directions for dropping off the ransom money, since someone else might try to pick up the money. (Kidnappers are such suspicious people.) The message would be anonymous, so there would be no source verification.</p>
<p class="docText">Integrity protection would be somewhat important, to prevent someone from guessing that the first part of the message was the proof that they were the kidnappers, and substitute a different second part of the message, with different directions for dropping off ransom money.</p>
<p class="docText">In some sense in this example there is source authenticationÂit's just not done with cryptography by the mail system. Instead the contents of the message provide source authentication by humans. We know of no systems that provide this odd combination (message integrity without source authentication), and kidnappers represent such a small market that none is likely to be developed.</p>
<p class="docText">It's meaningless to provide integrity protection without source authentication if the message is unencrypted, because anyone can remove the message from the wire and construct a different message. It isn't possible to do message integrity without source authentication with secret key technology, since the sender must share a secret with the recipient, so the recipient will know who the message came from based on which secret key is used.</p>
<p class="docText">If the message is encrypted (where the sender knows the public key of the recipient), it is possible to do something that could be considered integrity protection without source authentication. It is still possible for someone to remove the entire message from the wire and substitute a different message. But what can be ensured with an encrypted message is that the entire message came from one source, although the source is anonymous.</p>
