<h3 id="title-IDAQ45ON" class="docSection1Title">23.6. Denial-of-Service Attacks</h3>
<p class="docText">A <span class="docEmphStrong">denial-of-service attack</span> is one in which an attacker prevents good guys from accessing a service, but does not enable unauthorized access to any services. In the naive old days, security people dismissed the prospect of denial-of-service attacks as unlikely, since the attacker had nothing to gain. Of course that turned out to be faulty reasoning. There are terrorists, disgruntled employees, and people who delight in causing mischief for no good reason.</p>
<p class="docText">In the earliest types of denial-of-service attacks, the attacker repeatedly sent messages to the victim machine. Most machines at the time were vulnerable to this sort of attack since they had resources that could easily be depleted. For instance, the storage area for keeping track of pending TCP connections tended to be very limited, on the order of, say, ten connections. The probability of ten legitimate users connecting during a single network round trip time was sufficiently small that ten was a reasonable number. But it was easy for the attacking machine to fill up this table, even if the attacking machine was attached to the Internet with a low-speed link.</p>
<p class="docText">To avoid being caught at this mischief, it was common for the attacker to send these malicious packets from forged source addresses. This made it difficult to find (and prosecute) the attacker, and it made it difficult to recognize packets from the malicious machine and filter them at a firewall.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1050"></a><a name="iddle1287"></a><a name="iddle1301"></a><a name="iddle2148"></a>In defense, people started deploying routers with the capability of doing sanity checks on the source address. These routers could be configured to drop packets with a source address that could not have legitimately come from the direction from which the packet was received. And end node storage areas were increased so that a single attacker, at the speeds at which such attackers were typically connected to the Internet, could not fill the pending TCP connection table.</p>
<p class="docText">Another level of escalation was to send a single packet that caused a lot of legitimate machines to send messages to the victim machine. An example of such a packet is a packet transmitted to the broadcast address on some LAN, with the packet's source address forged to the address of the victim's machine, asking for all receivers to respond. All the machines on that LAN will send a response to the victim's machine. Such a mechanism magnifies the effect the attacker can have from his single machine, since each packet he creates turns into <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> packets directed at the victim machine.</p>
<p class="docText">The next level of escalation is known as a <span class="docEmphStrong">distributed denial-of-service attack</span>. In this form of attack the attacker breaks into a lot of innocent machines, and installs software on them to have them all attack the victim machine. These innocent machines are called <span class="docEmphStrong">zombies</span> or <span class="docEmphStrong">drones</span>. With enough zombies, any machine can be made inaccessible, since even if the machine itself can process packets as fast as they can possibly arrive (i.e., the speed of the wire attaching it to the Internet), the links or routers in front of that machine can be overwhelmed. Since the packets are coming from hundreds or thousands of innocent machines, it is hard to distinguish these packets from packets coming from legitimate users.</p>
