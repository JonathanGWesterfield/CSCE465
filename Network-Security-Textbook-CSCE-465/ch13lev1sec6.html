<p class="docText">Having a single KDC for an entire network is a problem for many reasons. With replicated KDCs, you can alleviate bottleneck problems and eliminate the single-point-of-failure problem. However, there is a serious problem which creation of redundant KDCs does not solve.</p>
<p class="docText">Imagine a big network consisting of several organizations such as companies in competition with each other, various universities, banks, and government agencies. It would be hard to find an organization that everyone would trust to manage the KDC. Whoever manages the KDC can access every user's master key, and therefore access everything that every user can access. Furthermore, that highly trusted entity would also be a busy one, having to process all instances of users and services joining and leaving the network.</p>
<p class="docText">Even if there were an organization everyone was willing to trust, this is not enough. Everyone must also trust the physical controls around every replica of the KDC, and there would have to be widely dispersed replicas to ensure availability and convenience. Compromise of any replica, no matter how obscurely placed it was, would yield everyone's keys.</p>
<p class="docText">For this reason the principals in the network are divided into <b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_180">realms</a></b>. Each realm has its own KDC database. There can be multiple KDCs in a realm, but they would be equivalent, have the same KDC master key, and have the same database of principals' master keys. Two KDCs in different realms, however, would have different KDC master keys and totally different principals' master key databases, since they would be responsible for a different set of principals.</p>
<p class="docText">In V4, a name of a principal has three components, each of which is a null-terminated case-sensitive text string of up to 40 characters: <span class="docEmphSmaller">NAME, INSTANCE</span>, and <span class="docEmphSmaller">REALM</span>. The Kerberos protocol does not particularly care how the <span class="docEmphSmaller">NAME</span> and <span class="docEmphSmaller">INSTANCE</span> fields are used. They are merely text strings. However, in practice, services have a name, and the <span class="docEmphSmaller">INSTANCE</span> field is used to indicate the particular machine on which the service is running. For example the file service might be called <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">fileserv</span> and a particular instance might be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">jailbreak</span>, for the name of one of the fileserver machines.</p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphSmaller">INSTANCE</span> field is not as useful for human principals, and usually the null string would be used for the instance part of the name. But as long as there is that component to a name, the convention for humans is that it is used to denote something about the role of the human for that particular login session. For example, someone can have the name <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Alice</span> and the instance <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">systemmanager</span>, or the name <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Alice</span> and the instance <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">gameplayer</span>. Presumably <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Alice.systemmanager</span> would have access to many more network resources than <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Alice.gameplayer</span>. In effect, a name is really a concatentation of the two strings <span class="docEmphSmaller">NAME</span> and <span class="docEmphSmaller">INSTANCE</span>. Kerberos could certainly have done without the concept of instance, and by convention principals could just use different names in their various roles. As a matter of fact, if &quot;.&quot; were a legal character in the text string for a name, the names could be identical to what they are currently, without having to separate them officially into two fields (<span class="docEmphSmaller">NAME</span> and <span class="docEmphSmaller">INSTANCE</span>).</p>
