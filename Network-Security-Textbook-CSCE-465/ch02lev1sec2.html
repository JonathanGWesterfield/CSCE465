<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1044"></a><a name="iddle1066"></a><a name="iddle1188"></a><a name="iddle1893"></a>What do we mean when we speak of a bad guy Fred <span class="docEmphasis">breaking</span> an encryption scheme? The three basic attacks are known as <span class="docEmphStrong">ciphertext only</span>, <span class="docEmphStrong">known plaintext</span>, and <span class="docEmphStrong">chosen plaintext</span>.</p>
<a name="ch02lev2sec4"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDA5I4LD" class="docSection2Title">2.2.1. Ciphertext Only</h4>
<p class="docText">In a ciphertext only attack, Fred has seen (and presumably stored) some ciphertext that he can analyze at leisure. Typically it is not difficult for a bad guy to obtain ciphertext. (If a bad guy can't access the encrypted data, then there would have been no need to encrypt the data in the first place!)</p>
<p class="docText">How can Fred figure out the plaintext if all he can see is the ciphertext? One possible strategy is to search through all the keys. Fred tries the decrypt operation with each key in turn. It is essential for this attack that Fred be able to recognize when he has succeeded. For instance, if the message was English text, then it is highly unlikely that a decryption operation with an incorrect key could produce something that looked like intelligible text. Because it is important for Fred to be able to differentiate plaintext from gibberish, this attack is sometimes known as a <span class="docEmphStrong">recognizable plaintext</span> attack.</p>
<p class="docText">It is also essential that Fred have enough ciphertext. For instance, using the example of a monoalphabetic cipher, if the only ciphertext available to Fred were <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">XYZ</span>, then there is not enough information. There are many possible letter substitutions that would lead to a legal three-letter English word. There is no way for Fred to know whether the plaintext corresponding to <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">XYZ</span> is <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">THE</span> or <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">CAT</span> or <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">HAT</span>. As a matter of fact, in the following sentence, any of the words could be the plaintext for <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">XYZ</span>:</p>

<p class="docText">[Don't worryÂwe've found a lovely sanatorium for the coauthor who wrote that.</p>
<p class="docText">Â<span class="docEmphasis">the other coauthors</span>]</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Often it isn't necessary to search through a lot of keys. For instance, the authentication scheme Kerberos (see &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch13lev1sec4.html#ch13lev1sec4">13.4</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Logging Into the Network</span>) assigns to user Alice a <span class="docEmphRoman"><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_070">DES</a></span> key derived from Alice's password according to a straightforward, published algorithm. If Alice chooses her password unwisely (say a word in the dictionary), then Fred does not need to search through all 2<sup>56</sup> possible DES keysÂinstead he only needs to try the derived keys of the 10000 or so common English words.</p>
<p class="docText">A cryptographic algorithm has to be secure against a ciphertext only attack because of the accessibility of the ciphertext to cryptanalysts. But in many cases cryptanalysts can obtain additional information, so it is important to design cryptographic systems to withstand the next two attacks as well.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAPM4LD" class="docSection2Title">2.2.2. Known Plaintext</h4>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1043"></a><a name="iddle1053"></a><a name="iddle1182"></a><a name="iddle1553"></a>Sometimes life is easier for the attacker. Suppose Fred has somehow obtained some &lt;plaintext, ciphertext&gt; pairs. How might he have obtained these? One possibility is that secret data might not remain secret forever. For instance, the data might consist of specifying the next city to be attacked. Once the attack occurs, the plaintext to the previous day's ciphertext is now known.</p>
<p class="docText">With a monoalphabetic cipher, a small amount of known plaintext would be a bonanza. From it, the attacker would learn the mappings of a substantial fraction of the most common letters (every letter that was used in the plaintext Fred obtained). Some cryptographic schemes might be good enough to be secure against ciphertext only attacks but not good enough against known plaintext attacks. In these cases, it becomes important to design the systems that use such a cryptographic algorithm to minimize the possibility that a bad guy will ever be able to obtain &lt;<span class="docEmphasis">plaintext</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">ciphertext</span>&gt; pairs.</p>
<a name="ch02lev2sec6"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDA5N4LD" class="docSection2Title">2.2.3. Chosen Plaintext</h4>
<p class="docText">On rare occasions, life may be easier still for the attacker. In a chosen plaintext attack, Fred can choose any plaintext he wants, and get the system to tell him what the corresponding ciphertext is. How could such a thing be possible?</p>
<p class="docText">Suppose the telegraph company offered a service in which they encrypt and transmit messages for you. Suppose Fred had eavesdropped on Alice's encrypted message. Now he'd like to break the telegraph company's encryption scheme so that he can decrypt Alice's message.</p>
<p class="docText">He can obtain the corresponding ciphertext to any message he chooses by paying the telegraph company to send the message for him, encrypted. For instance, if Fred knew they were using a monoalphabetic cipher, he might send the message</p>
<p><table cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" cellpadding="5"><colgroup align="center" span="1"><col width="550"></col></colgroup><thead></thead><tr><td class="docTableCell" align="center" valign="top"><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRomanAlt">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</span></p></td></tr></table></p><br />
<p class="docText">knowing that he would thereby get all the letters of the alphabet encrypted and then be able to decrypt with certainty any encrypted message.</p>
<p class="docText">It is possible that a cryptosystem secure against ciphertext only and known plaintext attacks might still be susceptible to chosen plaintext attacks. For instance, if Fred knows that Alice's message is either <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Surrender</span> or <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Fight on</span>, then no matter how wonderful an encryption scheme the telegraph company is using, all he has to do is send the two messages and see which one looks like the encrypted data he saw when Alice's message was transmitted.</p>
<p class="docText">A cryptosystem should resist all three sorts of attacks. That way its users don't need to worry about whether there are any opportunities for attackers to know or choose plaintext. Like wearing both a belt and suspenders, many systems that use cryptographic algorithms will also go out of their way to prevent any chance of chosen plaintext attacks.</p>
