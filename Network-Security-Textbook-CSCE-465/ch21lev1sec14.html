<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1646"></a>PEM only provides integrity protection or privacy on the <span class="docEmphasis">contents</span> of a message. There is other information in a message, however, and if people use PEM carelessly there are interesting security flaws that can be exploited. PEM does not protect the <span class="docEmphSmaller">SUBJECT</span>, <span class="docEmphSmaller">TO</span>, <span class="docEmphSmaller">FROM</span>, or <span class="docEmphSmaller">TIMESTAMP</span> field. How can a bad guy exploit the fact that PEM does not protect these fields?</p>
<p class="docText">Why would it be nice to cryptographically protect the subject line? A naive user might put private information into the subject line, and expose the information to an eavesdropper. Or suppose Alice sees a message from Fred, in which Fred suggests some outrageous idea. Alice forwards Fred's message, integrity-protected, with the subject line <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Fire this Bozo immediately</span>, but someone modifies the unprotected subject line to <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Great idea! Implement this suggestion immediately</span>. Since the subject line is not protected, the message will arrive signed by Alice, but having the subject line modified completely changes what she intended to say.</p>
<p class="docText">The <span class="docEmphSmaller">TO</span> and <span class="docEmphSmaller">FROM</span> fields cannot be encrypted because the mail infrastructure needs to see them. Theoretically they could be included in the integrity protection even though they couldn't be privacy-protected. PEM didn't do this because mailers tend to mangle these fields. PEM could have gotten around this by making a copy of that information and moving it inside the message.</p>
<p class="docText">It's unfortunate that PEM doesn't integrity-protect the <span class="docEmphSmaller">TO</span> field. For instance, Alice might send the signed message <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">I agree to donate $1000 to your organization</span> to organization Z, and the message might be copied and used by organization Y to fool Alice's underlings into sending them money also.</p>
<p class="docText">An example of where it is unfortunate that PEM didn't do something with the <span class="docEmphSmaller">FROM</span> field is where secret key based interchange keys are used and Alice sends a message to a distribution list located on a remote exploder. The remote exploder has to check Alice's MIC and then add its own per-recipient MIC. PEM does not provide any cryptographically protected method for the exploder to assert that it did indeed check and the message had come from Alice.</p>
<p class="docText">The other piece of header information that is not cryptographically protected is the timestamp. This doesn't seem too important. Even naive users would realize that if the time of sending a message were important, they should date the message in the text. Naive users would probably not even know that the mail infrastructure adds a time of posting.</p>
<p class="docText">Note that even if PEM protected all the header fields, it would be possible to misuse electronic mail. For instance, if Alice sends Bob the signed message <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">I approve</span>, Bob can't use the message later to prove that Alice okayed his action, since the message isn't explicit about what Alice was approving.</p>
<p class="docText">If Alice is careful, most of these PEM problems can be worked around. To protect the header information, Alice should include the header information in the text. The only problem we've described that has no PEM workaround is that a remote mail exploder cannot cryptographically assert that a message using secret interchange keys did originate with Alice.</p>
