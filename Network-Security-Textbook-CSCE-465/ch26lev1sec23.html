<h3 id="643999-817" class="docSection1Title">26.23. Timing Attacks</h3>
<p class="docText">People want smart cards to be tamper proof, with no way of being able to obtain the private key from the card. An interesting attack that has been found on smart cards to gain information about the key is to observe how long it takes to do various operations on various types of input. This yields information such as how many 1 bits are in the exponent, because exponentiation takes longer when the exponent has a lot of 1's. Similarly, the smart card might use a different amount of power when it is exponentiating than when it is reducing mod <span class="docEmphasis">n</span>, so by measuring the power used, and knowing, for various inputs, when that input would need to be reduced given different sized exponents, more information about that smart card's private key can be obtained.</p>
<p class="docText">To defend against such attacks, it is possible to do things that make it harder for the system using the smart card to control what operations the smart card is doing. Instead of just exponentiating the supplied number, for example, the smart card could multiply the supplied number by a randomly chosen number, do the exponentiation, and then divide by the exponentiated random number. Techniques like this either add noise to the information returned by the timing attack or pad things out to a fixed value. The techniques usually come with some performance cost.</p>
<p class="docText">Some people misapply this smart card protection to servers speaking across a network, and attempt to yield no timing information about the exponent by introducing a random amount of delay when the server performs private key operations. This is usually unnecessary since any timing differences based on computation with a particular exponent would be dwarfed by network delays and delays due to server loading. There are some operations for which computation might be significant compared to the other delays. One example is the computation delays in PDM (see &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch12lev1sec3.html#ch12lev1sec3">12.3</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Strong Password Protocols</span>) of computing a safe prime from the user's password. This can be avoided by having the workstation compute the prime before it connects to the server, so an observer on the network cannot tell how long the workstation took to compute the prime.</p>
<p class="docText">A related problem in the network case is traffic analysis. For instance, as shown in SONG01, information can be gleaned by observing the pattern of packets. One example is being able to see how many characters are in a user's password, since some implementations would send a separate packet for each character typed. (To a computer, the delays between character strokes are really long: &quot;Geesh. That human is sure a slow input device. I'm certainly not waiting around for it to type another character!&quot;)</p>
