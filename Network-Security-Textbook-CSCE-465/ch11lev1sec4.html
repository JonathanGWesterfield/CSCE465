<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1086"></a><a name="iddle1098"></a><a name="iddle1518"></a><a name="iddle1625"></a><a name="iddle2067"></a>In <a class="docLink" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Overview of Authentication Systems</span>, we discussed the concept of a KDC, which has a database consisting of keys for all users. Any user Alice registered with the KDC can securely communicate with the KDC. Alice and the KDC can authenticate each other and encrypt their communication to one another because they each know Alice's key:</p>
<p class="docText">In the above exchange, the KDC does not know whether it was really Alice that asked to talk to Bob. Some bad guy, Trudy, could send the message to the KDC saying <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">I am Alice, I'd like to talk to Bob</span>. But that won't do Trudy any good because she cannot decrypt the encrypted <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>. Trudy is causing Bob to get a spurious message that Alice wants to talk to him using key <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>, but it doesn't do any harm. The only parties that can know <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub> after this exchange are the KDC, Bob, and Alice, so after this exchange Alice and Bob can mutually authenticate using key <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub> (using a protocol such as discussed in &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch11lev1sec2.html#ch11lev1sec2">11.2</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Mutual Authentication</span>).</p>
<p class="docText"><a class="docLink" href="#ch11fig16">Protocol 11-16</a> is not the way it is done in practice. That protocol has some practical problems, the most important of which is that if Alice immediately sends a message to Bob based on the new shared key, it's possible, given the vagaries of networks, for Alice's message to arrive first, in which case Bob would not know how to decrypt it. It also is a lot of trouble for the KDC to initiate a connection to Bob. Instead, since Alice is going to communicate with Bob anyway, the KDC gives Alice the information the KDC would have sent to Bob. The Kerberos protocol, which we'll describe in <a class="docLink" href="ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Kerberos V4</span> and <a class="docLink" href="ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Kerberos V5</span>, refers to the encrypted piece of information that the KDC gives to Alice to pass along to Bob as a <b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_224">ticket</a></b> to Bob. The ticket is information that will allow Alice to access Bob:</p>

<h4 id="title-IDACPW0R" class="docSection2Title">11.4.1. Needham-Schroeder</h4>
<p class="docText">A classic protocol for authentication using KDCs was designed by Needham and Schroeder. It is very similar to the protocol we just described, and it completes the exchange by doing the mutual authentication between Alice and Bob. [<a class="docLink" href="biblio01.html#biblio01_120">NEED78</a>]. The Needham Schroeder protocol is important because it is a classic KDC-arbitrated authentication protocol and many others have been modeled after it. The Kerberos protocol is based on it, and it is instructive to understand its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p class="docText">The paper gives a few variants, but the basic Needham-Schroeder protocol is shown as <a class="docLink" href="#ch11fig18">Protocol 11-18</a>. Let's analyze this protocol. First we must apologize for the arcaneness of the analysis. It's unfortunately necessary to go into this depth in order to really understand a protocol. Without a thorough understanding, there might be subtle security flaws.</p>
<a name="ch11fig18"></a><p><center>
<h5 class="docFigureTitle">Protocol 11-18. Needham-Schroeder</h5>
</center></p><p class="docText"><div class="v1"><a target="_blank" href="11fig18_alt.jpg">[View full size image]</a></div><img border="0" alt="" id="118095009249" width="500" height="200" src="11fig18.jpg" /></p>
<br />
<p class="docText">The terminology <b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_138">nonce</a></b> refers to a number that is used only once. A nonce could be a sequence number (provided that state is not lost during crashes), or a large random number. It also could be a timestamp, if you believe that your clock never goes backwards, but Needham and Schroeder specifically wanted to avoid dependence on timestamps (see &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch11lev1sec5.html#ch11lev1sec5">11.5</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Nonce Types</span> for more detail on nonces).</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2068"></a>Message 1 tells the KDC that Alice wants to talk to Bob. The purpose of the nonce <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>1</sub> is to assure Alice that she is really talking to the KDC. The (admittedly far-fetched) threat the protocol is trying to avoid is where Trudy has stolen an old key of Bob's, and stolen the message where Alice had previously requested a key for Bob. Bob, realizing Trudy has stolen his key, has changed his key. Trudy waits around until Alice makes a request to the KDC to talk to Bob. Trudy then replays the stolen message, which looks like an ordinary reply from the KDC. Then Trudy successfully impersonates Bob to Alice, because Trudy knows the key that Alice thinks the KDC just created for Alice and Bob. As we've already said, it is hard to imagine a circumstance where this would be a practical threat, but adding the nonce costs virtually nothing, and it removes the need to think about whether the threat might be practical in any particular circumstance.</p>
<p class="docText">In message 2, the KDC securely (i.e. encrypted and integrity-protected) gives Alice the key <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub> it has generated for Alice and Bob to share. It puts in the string &quot;Bob&quot; to make it impossible for Trudy to tamper with Alice's request, substituting the string &quot;Trudy&quot; for &quot;Bob&quot; and then being able to trick Alice into talking to Trudy and thinking that Trudy is Bob. If Trudy were to tamper with message 1 by substituting her name for Bob's, then Alice will discover, in message 2, that the KDC has just given her a key to communicate with Trudy, not Bob. In message 2, along with the encrypted key <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub> and Bob's name, the KDC also gives Alice a ticket to Bob. The ticket to Bob consists of the key <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub> and Alice's name, encrypted with Bob's key. To Alice, the ticket will just be a pile of unintelligible bits. The Needham-Schroeder protocol has been criticized for doubly encrypting the ticket. The ticket is sent encrypted with Alice's key, though it would have been just as secure to send it in the clear.</p>
<p class="docText">In message 3, Alice sends a challenge (<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>2</sub>) to Bob, encrypted with <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>, along with the ticket. Bob decrypts the ticket to find the shared key <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>. He uses <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub> to extract <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>2</sub>. Alice knows that only someone who knows Bob's key can decrypt the ticket and thereby discover the shared key <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>. In message 4, Bob proves he knows <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>, since he was able to find <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>2</sub>. Likewise, Bob assumes that it must be Alice if she knows <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub> because the KDC puts Alice's name in the ticket with <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>. In message 4, in addition to sending back <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>2</sub> (actually a decremented version of <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>2</sub>), he includes a challenge <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>3</sub> encrypted with <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>, and Alice sends back (in message 5) a message proving she knows <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>.</p>
<p class="docText">There is an interesting reflection attack to which the protocol would be vulnerable if the encryption in message 4 were done using, say, DES in ECB mode. Suppose each of the nonces were 64 bits long. Because of the nature of ECB, <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>2</sub>-1 and <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>3</sub> would each be separately encrypted. Suppose Trudy wants to impersonate Alice to Bob. First she eavesdrops on an authentication handshake where Alice talks to Bob. So Trudy sees messages 3 and 4. Later, she replays message 3 to Bob. Bob will respond with <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>2</sub>-1,<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>4</sub>} (where <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>4</sub> is a nonce different from the one Bob chose last time he talked to Alice). Trudy can't return <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>4</sub>-1}, but she can open a new connection to Bob, this time splicing in <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>4</sub>} instead of <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>2</sub>}. Bob will return <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>4</sub>-1,<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>5</sub>}. Then Trudy can take the first encrypted block, which will be <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>4</sub>-1} and return that as message 5 of her first connection. In fact she will never have found out what <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>4</sub> was, but she didn't need to know <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>4</sub>. She just needed to know <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>4</sub>-1}.</p>
<p class="docText">If encryption were done in CBC mode instead of ECB mode, Trudy would not be able to accomplish this, because she couldn't splice pieces of messages. But if encryption were done in CBC mode, there would be no reason to have Bob and Alice decrement each other's nonces. Message 4 could just as securely be <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>2</sub>,<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>3</sub>}, and message 5 could just as securely be <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>3</sub>}.</p>
<p class="docText">The lesson to be learned is that if pieces of a message must, for security reasons, be sent together, then the entire message must be integrity-protected so that parts of it cannot be modified by an attacker.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDARWW0R" class="docSection2Title">11.4.2. Expanded Needham-Schroeder</h4>
<p class="docText">There is a remaining security vulnerability with <a class="docLink" href="#ch11fig18">Protocol 11-18</a>. Suppose Trudy finds out Alice's key. Trudy can of course, at that point, claim to be Alice and get the KDC to give Trudy (which the KDC thinks is Alice), a shared key to Bob and a ticket to Bob. There's really nothing we can do about Trudy impersonating Alice if Trudy steals Alice's key. But we'd like it to be possible to prevent Trudy from doing any more damage once Alice changes her key. The problem is, with the protocol we've just described, the ticket to Bob stays valid even if Alice changes her key.</p>
<p class="docText">The vulnerability can occur even if Trudy only manages to capture a previous key used by Alice, say <span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>Alice</sub>, and not the key Alice is using now. Suppose that when Alice was using <span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>Alice</sub>, Trudy had overheard (and recorded) Alice asking the KDC for a ticket for Bob. At that time, the KDC would have generated a shared key <span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>AB</sub>, and Trudy would have seen <span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>Alice</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>1</sub>,&quot;Bob&quot;, <span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>AB</sub>,<span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>AB</sub>,&quot;Alice&quot;}}. At the time, Trudy could not decrypt the message, but we'll assume she's stored it away, hoping to capture an old key of Alice's. Once Trudy does discover <span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>Alice</sub>, she can interpret the messages she's recorded, discover <span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>AB</sub>, and, using the ticket <a name="iddle1170"></a><a name="iddle1754"></a><span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>AB</sub>,&quot;Alice&quot;}, she can convince Bob that Alice will be talking to him using <span class="docEmphasis">J</span><sub>AB</sub>. The fact that the KDC knew Alice's key changed is irrelevant; the KDC doesn't participate in this new authentication.</p>
<p class="docText">A paper [<a class="docLink" href="biblio01.html#biblio01_040">DENN81</a>] pointed out this weakness, and in [<a class="docLink" href="biblio01.html#biblio01_121">NEED87</a>], a suggested fix was proposed by adding two additional messages. Alice requests a nonce <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>B</sub> from Bob, which Alice will send to the KDC, and the KDC will package <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>B</sub> in the ticket to Bob. This will reassure Bob that whoever is talking to him has talked to the KDC since Bob generated <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>B</sub>. Once Alice changes her key, Trudy will not be able to talk to the KDC using Alice's old key, and any recorded messages from the KDC using an old key of Alice's will also not be useful. The proposed protocol added 2 messages, and therefore uses 7 messages. The protocol can, however, be reduced to 6 messages (see <a class="docLink" href="ch11lev1sec9.html#ch11qa1q9">Homework Problem 9</a>).</p>

<p class="docText">In [<a class="docLink" href="biblio01.html#biblio01_122">OTWA87</a>], an improved authentication protocol is given. It also solves the ticket invalidation problem, and it does mutual authentication in 5 messages.</p>
<p class="docText">Otway and Rees mention that they were inspired by a remark from Needham that <span class="docEmphasis">the suspicious party should always generate a challenge</span>. Let's look at their protocol (<a class="docLink" href="#ch11fig20">Protocol 11-20</a>). Alice generates two nonces. One, <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub>, is sent in the clear to Bob. In addition <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub> is included (along with the other nonce, <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>A</sub>) in a message encrypted by Alice that Bob cannot interpret. It just looks like a pile of bits, and he will simply forward <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Alice</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>A</sub>,<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub>,&quot;Alice&quot;,&quot;Bob&quot;} to the KDC.</p>

</center></p><p class="docText">
<img border="0" alt="" id="118095009249" width="500" height="234" src="11fig20.jpg" /></p>
<br />
<p class="docText">In message 2, Bob forwards the encrypted message Alice sent, along with a message Bob encrypts which includes his own nonce <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>B</sub>, the nonce <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub> that Alice sent in the clear, &quot;Alice&quot;, and &quot;Bob&quot;, to the KDC. The KDC checks to make sure that the common nonce <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub> is the same in both encrypted messages. If not, the KDC will reject the message. The fact that they are the same proves that Bob is really Bob, since only someone knowing <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub> can encrypt <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub> inside a message.</p>
<p class="docText">In message 3, the KDC gives Bob a message to forward to Alice. That message, when forwarded to Alice, reassures Alice that both the KDC and Bob are legitimate. (Alice knows the KDC is legitimate because it encrypts <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>A</sub> with key <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Alice</sub>. Alice knows Bob is legitimate because the KDC would not have continued the protocol if it hadn't already verified that Bob was legit.) The KDC also tells Bob the common key, and reassures Bob that it is really the KDC by putting Bob's nonce <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>B</sub> inside the message to Bob.</p>
<p class="docText">Message 4 is merely having Bob forward <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Alice</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>A</sub>,<span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>} to Alice. In message 5, Alice proves her identity to Bob by showing that she knows <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>AB</sub>. Bob does not need to prove his identity explicitly to Alice because Alice will assume that the KDC authenticated Bob.</p>
<p class="docText">In fact, this protocol could be simplified by getting rid of one of Alice's nonces (see <a class="docLink" href="ch11lev1sec9.html#ch11qa1q4">Homework Problem 4</a>).</p>
<p class="docText">If we want to be really paranoid, then for subtle reasons it is necessary in the Otway-Rees protocol that <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub> be not just a nonce but also unpredictable. Otherwise Trudy, in a rather involved scenario, could impersonate Bob to Alice. This is the way it would work: Suppose Alice is using a sequence number for <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub>. Trudy watches and sees that Alice is currently using, say, 007 for <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub>. So Trudy sends a message to Bob claiming to be Alice. She sends <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">008, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, <span class="docEmphasis">garbage</span></span>. Bob can't tell that the fourth element in the message is garbage. He forwards <span class="docEmphasis">garbage</span> on, along with his <a name="iddle1084"></a><a name="iddle1525"></a><a name="iddle1703"></a>own message <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>B</sub>,008,&quot;Alice&quot;,&quot;Bob&quot;}. Trudy records that message. The KDC will reject Bob's message, since the garbage won't decrypt properly. Then Trudy waits until Alice generates her next request to talk to Bob. That will be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">008, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, K<sub>Alice</sub>{N<sub>A</sub>,008,&quot;Alice&quot;,&quot;Bob&quot;}</span>. Trudy forwards that, along with the message <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>B</sub>,008,&quot;Alice&quot;,&quot;Bob&quot;} she recorded from Bob, to the KDC. The KDC will accept the messages now since both will contain 008. The only authentication of Bob in the Otway-Rees protocol is done by the KDC verifying that the nonce <span class="docEmphasis">N</span><sub>C</sub> is the same in the message encrypted with <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub> and the message encrypted with <span class="docEmphRomanAlt"><span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Alice</sub></span>. Trudy can complete the exchange by forwarding to Alice the message the KDC sends her for Alice. Alice will wrongly assume the party to whom she is talking is Bob. If Alice and Bob are planning on using the shared key, say for encrypting the messages to one another, then Trudy won't have succeeded. But if all Alice and Bob want to do is authenticate, then Trudy will have successfully impersonated Bob to Alice.</p>
<p class="docText">The Kerberos authentication service (see <a class="docLink" href="ch13.html#ch13">Chapter 13</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Kerberos V4</span>) is roughly based on the Needham-Schroeder protocol. It looks a lot simpler than these protocols because it assumes a universal idea of time, and includes expiration dates in messages. The basic Kerberos protocol is:</p>
