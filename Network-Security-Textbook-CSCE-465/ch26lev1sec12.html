<h3 id="title-IDA1SJTK" class="docSection1Title">26.12. Key Expansion</h3>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Key expansion</span> is the technique of using a small number of random bits as a seed and from it deriving lots of bits of keys. For instance, from a 128-bit random seed, you might want to derive 128-bit encryption keys and 128-bit integrity keys in each direction. Or you might want to periodically do key rollover (without PFS) lots of times, using the same seed.</p>
<p class="docText">The alternative to key expansion is obtaining independent random numbers for each key. It might be expensive to obtain that many random bits. For instance, if the random number is sent encrypted with the other side's public key, it is convenient to limit the size of the random number to fit within an RSA block. And if an unpredictably many future keys also need to be derived from the same keying material, you wouldn't know how large a random number you'd need.</p>
<p class="docText">If the random number is sufficiently large (say 80 bits or more), then it can be used as the seed for an unlimited number of keys. It is important to do this in such a way that divulging one key <a name="iddle1543"></a><a name="iddle1604"></a>does not compromise other keys. So each key is usually derived from the random number seed and some other information (such as a key version number or timestamp), using a one-way function.</p>
<p class="docText">The random number from which all other keys are derived is often known as the <span class="docEmphStrong">master key</span> or <span class="docEmphStrong">key seed</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">In many protocols, creating and/or communicating the initial secret is expensive. For instance, in SSL/TLS it involves sending something encrypted with the other side's public key, and decrypting it will therefore be expensive. Another example is IPsec, in which creating the initial secret involves a Diffie-Hellman exchange, which is expensive for both sides. Reusing the original secret for generating new keys will be less expensive than creating and sending a new random seed.</p>
<p class="docText">In the cryptography community, companies with outrageous claims and bogus security products are known as &quot;snake-oil&quot; companies. A common claim made by the snake-oil marketeers is that the company's algorithm uses keys of some huge size, perhaps millions of bits, and that that makes them much more secure than, say, the 128-bit keys used by other companies. (And they usually have a &quot;patented&quot;, proprietary encryption scheme.) There are many aspects of such a statement that should raise the suspicion that the claims are snake-oil. Often the million-bit key is generated from a very small seed, perhaps 32 bits, which through key expansion turns into many bits. So even though the key used might be a million bits, if the seed from which it is computed is 32 bits, then the key itself is equivalent to a 32-bit key.</p>
