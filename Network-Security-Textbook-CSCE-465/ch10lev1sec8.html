<h3 id="title-IDAORO3O" class="docSection1Title">10.8. Authentication Tokens</h3>
<p class="docText">An authentication token is a physical device that a person carries around and uses in authenticating. In the breakdown of security according to <span class="docEmphasis">what you know</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">what you have</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">what you are</span>, authentication tokens fall in the middle category (passwords are in the first, and biometric devices the third). Generally, authentication tokens offer security advantages and disadvantages over other mechanisms. Unless they are physically attached to users (which is unacceptable in our culture), they are subject to theft. Generally they must be coupled with one of the other two mechanisms to be secure.</p>
<p class="docText">There are several forms of authentication token in use today. The most ubiquitous is the key that people use to unlock their home or car. Another common form of authentication token is the credit card. If a credit card includes a picture or a signature, it combines an authentication token with a primitive biometric device (the person who compares signatures or sees whether you look like the picture).</p>

The advantage that magnetic strip cards offer over simple passwords is that they are not trivial to reproduce and they can conveniently hold a secret larger than most people are willing to memorize. Perhaps the biggest advantage is psychologicalÂpeople tend to be less willing to &quot;loan&quot; a token to a friend than to share a password. There are a number of disadvantages:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Use of these tokens requires custom hardware (a key slot or card reader) on every access device. This may be expensive and it requires standardization.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Tokens can be lost or stolen. For reasonable security, tokens must be supplemented with a PIN or password. In most environments, a convenient override must be available for when &quot;I forgot my card at home.&quot; That override should not be substantially less convenient than the one for &quot;I forgot my password.&quot;</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">These devices offer little or no protection against communications eavesdropping. Whatever information is sent &quot;over the wire&quot; can be collected just like a password and replayed later. To make use of the information using a &quot;standard terminal&quot; requires that a card be manufactured to regurgitate the stolen information, but someone who can eavesdrop can likely connect a nonstandard terminal to the network and replay the information without making a card. There is nothing conceptually difficult about copying a key or mag-stripe card; devices for doing so are readily available.</p>
<p class="docText">A better form of authentication token is the <span class="docEmphStrong">smart card</span>. This is a device about the size of a credit card but with an embedded CPU and memory. When inserted in a (misleadingly named) <span class="docEmphStrong">smart card reader</span>, the card carries on a conversation with the device (as opposed to a magnetic strip, which simply dumps its contents). There are various forms of smart cards:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">PIN protected memory card.</span> With this card, there is information in the memory of the card that can only be read after a PIN is input to the card. Usually, after some number of wrong PIN guesses, the card &quot;locks&quot; itself and will not give the information to anyone. Information stored on such a smart card is safer than that stored on a magnetic strip card because a stolen card is useless without the PIN. These cards are more difficult to duplicate than magnetic strip cards, but it's still possible given the PIN.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Cryptographic challenge/response cards.</span> With this card, there is a cryptographic key in memory, and the card is willing to encrypt or decrypt using the key but will not reveal the key even after the PIN is entered. A computer that knows the key in the card can authenticate the user by creating a random challenge and &quot;challenging&quot; the card to encrypt or decrypt it. If the correct answer is returned, the computer can have confidence that the smart card is present and the correct PIN was entered. These cards can be constructed so as to be nearly impossible to duplicate or to extract the key from. Since there is no way to directly extract the key, it can only be done by disassembling or inserting probes into the card. There is a reciprocating escalation <a name="iddle1143"></a><a name="iddle1228"></a><a name="iddle1887"></a>in the technologies for probing the card and for packaging it to be unreadable. For most practical purposes, the cards are unreadable. Like keys and magnetic strip cards, the serious practical problems with smart cards are the need for readers at every access point and the need for recovery when a card is lost or forgotten. The cryptographic card offers substantial protection against eavesdropping.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Cryptographic calculator</span>(sometimes called a <span class="docEmphStrong">readerless smart card</span>). A cryptographic calculator is like a smart card in that it performs cryptographic calculations using a key that it will not disclose. It is unlike a smart card in that it requires no electrical connection to the terminal. It has a display and usually a keyboard, and all interaction is through the user. One way it could work is by simulating a smart card: The user enters a PIN to unlock the device; the computer wishing to authenticate the user generates a random challenge and displays it to the user; the user types it into the calculator; the calculator encrypts the value and displays the result; the user enters the result on the terminal; the computer does the same calculation and compares the results.</p><p class="docList">An alternative protocol that cuts the typing in half is for the calculator to encrypt the current time and display the result. The user types in this number in place of a password. There's a little more work for the computer since it will not be sure of the exact time that the calculator thinks it is (clocks drift); it will have to do the calculation on several candidate time values to verify what the device said. It might then record the accumulated clock skew to make the next such calculation easier. It's possible to eliminate the keyboard (needed for entering the PIN) from the calculator by having a PIN or password sent to the computer instead. It is important to have some form of PIN to prevent someone who steals the calculator from impersonating its owner. In addition to saving typing, another advantage of the time encryption protocol is that it fits the &quot;<span class="docEmphRoman"><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_093">form factor</a></span>&quot; of protocols designed for passwords. If a protocol has a &quot;password&quot; field and no way for the authenticating application to send a challenge, the encrypted time variant can still be made to work.</p><p class="docList">The biggest advantage of these readerless smart cards is that they can be used from ordinary terminals with no special hardware. Their popularity is growing among companies that want to let their employees log in from home using laptops and modems but are afraid of opening their networks up to intruders.</p></li></ul>
