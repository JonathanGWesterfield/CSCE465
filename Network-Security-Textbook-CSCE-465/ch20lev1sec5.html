<h3 id="title-IDA3LCZI" class="docSection1Title">20.5. Privacy</h3>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1309"></a><a name="iddle1851"></a><a name="iddle1968"></a>Most people think that electronic mail is private. But there are many ways in which inquiring minds can read your messages:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">An eavesdropper can listen to the message while it is being transmitted on the wire. Perhaps the network provides link encryption, in which case this one threat is avoided.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Relay nodes (routers or mail forwarders) might have software to store messages and divulge them to people other than the intended recipients. The relay node might be doing that because it has been compromised by a bad guy, or it might be the intended function of the node. For instance the relay node might be a security gateway, and the owners of the network may want the ability to monitor mail to and from the outside.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">There are often conflicting security needs. Alice wants to keep the contents of her message to Bob private. But Alice's employer might want the capability of monitoring her mail to ensure she isn't revealing company secrets. Another example is that citizens might want to be able to carry on private conversations, but their government might want to be able, under appropriate circumstances (of course), to monitor all communications.</p>
<a name="ch20lev2sec3"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAINCZI" class="docSection2Title">20.5.1. End-to-End Privacy</h4>
<p class="docText">Alice might want to send a message to Bob in such a way that only Bob can read it. She can't depend on the network keeping the message secret, but she can ensure that nobody but Bob can read the message by using cryptography to encrypt the message.</p>
<p class="docText">The natural assumption is that if Alice wants to send Bob an encrypted message, she encrypts it using Bob's public key (if public key technology is being used for keys) or by using the key she shares with Bob (if secret key technology is being used). However, this is not how mail encryption is generally done, for several reasons:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">If Alice has a long message to send to multiple recipients, the long message would have to be encrypted once for each recipient, producing a different version to be sent to each recipient.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Public key encryption is far less efficient than secret key encryption. So it is desirable to encrypt the message with secret key encryption even if Bob's key is a public key.</p></li><li><p class="docList">As described in &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch09lev1sec8.html#ch09lev1sec8">9.8</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Session Key Establishment</span>, it's not desirable to use a long-term key more than necessary. So to preserve the useful lifetime of the long-term key Alice and Bob share, it is preferable to encrypt as little as possible with a key that is expensive to replace.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1354"></a>So the way it is done is that Alice chooses a random secret key <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> to be used only for encrypting that one message. She encrypts the message with <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>, encrypts <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> with Bob's key, and transmits both quantities to Bob. Even if the message is being sent to multiple recipients, she only encrypts the message once, with key <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>. But she encrypts <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> once for each recipient, with the appropriate key, and includes each encrypted <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> with the encrypted message.</p>
<p class="docText">Let's assume Bob's key is <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub>, Carol's key is <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Carol</sub>, and Ted's key is <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Ted</sub>. If public key technology is being used, then <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub> is Bob's public key. If secret key technology is being used, then <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub> is the key that Alice shares with Bob. The message Alice would like to send to Bob, Carol, and Ted is <span class="docEmphasis">m</span>. <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> is the secret key Alice chose specifically for encrypting <span class="docEmphasis">m</span>. (We'll write <span class="docEmphasis">K</span>{<span class="docEmphasis">x</span>} to indicate <span class="docEmphasis">x</span> encrypted with key <span class="docEmphasis">K</span>.) The mail message Alice will send includes:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Bob's name; <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Bob</sub>{<span class="docEmphasis">S</span>}</p></li><li><p class="docList">Carol's name; <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Carol</sub>{S}</p></li><li><p class="docList">Ted's name; <span class="docEmphasis">K</span><sub>Ted</sub>{S}</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphasis">S</span>{<span class="docEmphasis">m</span>}</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">So, for example, the message Alice sends might look like this:</p>
<div class="docText"><pre>90</pre></div><br /><div class="docText"><pre>          <span class="docEmphStrong">To: Bob, Carol, Ted</span>
          <span class="docEmphStrong">From: Alice</span>
          <span class="docEmphStrong">Key-info: Bob-4280234208034</span>
          <span class="docEmphStrong">Key-info: Carol-48235235344848488</span>
          <span class="docEmphStrong">Key-info: Ted-99349248</span>
          <span class="docEmphStrong">Msg-info: RJekcr283hkjsdf8ghn327&amp;3489724&amp;#$*92</span></pre></div><br />
<p class="docText">In that way, each recipient can decrypt the appropriate encrypted version of the secret key, and each will use the same secret key to decrypt the message.</p>
<a name="ch20lev2sec4"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAPSCZI" class="docSection2Title">20.5.2. Privacy with Distribution List Exploders</h4>
<p class="docText">Suppose Alice is sending a message to a distribution list which will be remotely exploded, and Bob is only one of the recipients. Assume the distribution list is stored at some node remote from Alice, and that Alice does not even know the individuals on the distribution list. We can't assume she has keys for all the members of the distribution list. Instead, she has a key only for the distribution list exploder. Alice does not need to treat the distribution list exploder any differently than any other recipient of a message. It is merely someone she shares a key with and sends messages to. The distribution list exploder will need keys for all the individuals on the list.</p>
<p class="docText">As described in the end-to-end case, Alice will choose a random per-message secret key <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>, and encrypt the message with <span class="docEmphasis">S</span>. The distribution list exploder will decrypt <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> (but it does not need to <a name="iddle1156"></a><a name="iddle1415"></a><a name="iddle1998"></a><a name="iddle2017"></a>decrypt the message!), and re-encrypt <span class="docEmphasis">S</span> with the key for each recipient to whom it is forwarding the message.</p>
<p class="docText">Local exploding requires different mechanisms. Alice still has to trust the maintainer of the mailing list, since a bad guy could insert extra names into the distribution list. The distribution list is most likely just a list of names. Alice will not be able to send a secure message to a name without establishing a key for that individual.</p>
