<h3 id="643999-919" class="docSection1Title">14.13. PKINITÂPublic Keys for Users</h3>
<p class="docText">The design center for Kerberos is users with passwords and servers with high-quality secret keys shared with the KDC. There have been various efforts since at least 1990 to allow use of a public key infrastructure as an alternative to passwords for authenticating users. The dream of every user having a public/private key pairÂpreferably stored on a smart cardÂhas been no more than a few years off for all of that time, but it continues to elude us. PKINIT would provide the bridge between public key enabled users and legacy servers that know only secret key technology.</p>
<p class="docText">Servers don't know or care how a user authenticated to a KDC. They only see the resulting ticket, which vouches for the user's name. If a user had a private key and a certificate and obtained a TGT or Ticket from a KDC using a public key authentication protocol, this could be transparent and backwards compatible with existing servers. This is the exchange PKINIT defines.</p>
<p class="docText">The simplest form of PKI integration that Kerberos could have defined would be for the KDC to list the user's public key in its database instead of the user's password. The TGS_REP message could then have been sent to the user encrypted under that public key. It would also have to be signed by the KDC with some public key the user could verifyÂotherwise the user could be tricked by someone impersonating the KDC and subsequently impersonating other servers. This simple construction was one of the early proposals, but it did not survive ten years of committee deliberations.</p>
<p class="docText">Recall that there was a period from April 29, 1997 and September 20, 2000 when the patent on Diffie-Hellman had expired but the patent on RSA had not. During that period, there was an effort in the IETF to mandate use of unencumbered algorithms even if they were not technically appropriate. The suite pushed during that period was using DSS for signatures and Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman for encryption. So PKINIT was transformed to mandate that the ticket request be <a name="iddle1519"></a>signed and the reply be encrypted because that is what those algorithms required. Use of RSA is still allowed, but the optimization of allowing only a single private key operation on the client and being independent of PKI was not reinstated.</p>
<p class="docText">There is a structural similarity between using a series of KDCs to authenticate and having a chain of certificates in a PKI. In each case, a set of intermediaries is being trusted. In each case, the decision of which intermediaries should be trusted to authenticate which identities to one another could be configured either into the infrastructure itself (possibly using name constraint rules) or into each endpoint. Kerberos chose to leave that decision to the endpoints. To be consistent with that decision, a Kerberos KDC makes no judgement as to whether a particular chain of certificates is acceptable. Instead, it confirms that it knows (has configured) the name and public key of the first CA in the chain, and lists that and all subsequent CAs as transited realms in the issued ticket. While this leaves maximum flexibility to the configuration of the server, it means that it is unlikely that PKINIT meet its original goal of connecting public key enabled clients to existing Kerberos enabled servers without requiring reconfiguration of the server. PKINIT does allow (but does not require) a translation table in a KDC so that the client name sent to the server can be a familiar Kerberos name rather than the X.500 name taken from the client's certificate.</p>
