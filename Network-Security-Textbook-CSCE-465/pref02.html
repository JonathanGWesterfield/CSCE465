<p class="docText">Despite the controversies that crop up around security issues, it has been our experience that people in the security community are generally generous with their wisdom and time. It's always a little scary thanking specific people, for fear we'll leave someone out, but leaving everyone out seems wrong. It's not even the fair thing to do, since some people would be more egregiously wronged by being left out than others.</p>
<p class="docText">Eric Rescorla and Hilarie Orman have been particularly helpful with answering questions and reviewing chapters for this edition. Other reviewers, and people who have been helpful answering questions, include Tom Wu, Kevin Fu, Marshall Rose, Joe Tardo, Joe Pato, Seth Proctor, Timothy Spiller, Tom Rice, Kristen McIntyre, Gary Winiger, Dan Harkins, Peter Memishian, Jeff Schiller, Burt Kaliski, Tony Lauck, Phil Karn, Ron Rivest, Steve Crocker, Steve Kent, John Linn, Steve Hanna, Jim Bidzos, Dave Jablon, Ted Ts'o, Matthew Barnes, Keith McCloughrie, Jeffrey Case, Kathrin Winkler, Philippe Auphelle, Sig Handelman, Phillip Hallam-Baker, Uri Blumenthal, Serge Vaudenay, and Boyd Roberts.</p>
<p class="docText">We could not have done <a class="docLink" href="ch24.html#ch24">Chapter 24</a> <span class="docEmphasis">More Security Systems</span> without help from the various companies involved, since for the most part the security systems were previously undocumented. We'd like to thank Al Eldridge from Iris (Lotus Notes), Amir Herzberg and Mark Davis from IBM (KryptoKnight), Walt Tuvell from OSF, and Cliff Van Dyke from Microsoft (LAN Manager and Windows NT security) for explaining their systems to us, doing timely reviews of what we wrote, and being enthusiastic and supportive of the project. Although nearly 67% of us work for companies that have products in this area, the opinions we offer are ours alone, and not those of our companies.</p>
<p class="docText">Mary Franz, our editor at Prentice Hall, has been enthusiastic and optimistic and patient with us throughout. She's shown good judgment about when to be helpful, when to keep out of the way, when to nag, and when to just look soulful so we feel guilty enough to meet a deadline.</p>
<p class="docText">Despite the fact that this book has kept both of his parents busy for a significant part of his life, Ray Perlner has kept us inspired with his wholehearted and unselfish enthusiasm for the project. He's shown genuine interest in the subject matter, offered useful advice during interauthor arguments, helped search for quotes, reviewed part of the book, and particularly liked the subscripted pronouns. If we overdo those, it's just because it's fun to see him giggle. Dawn Perlner has also been a great supporter of the project, and manages to convince a surprising number of her friends, as well as complete strangers, to buy the book.</p>
<p class="docText">And of course we thank you, our reader. We welcome your comments and suggestions. Compliments are always welcome. We hope to update the book periodically, so if there are topics you wish we'd covered or errors you'd like us to correct, let us know. Errata can be found at <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.phptr.com/networksecurity">http://www.phptr.com/networksecurity</a>.</p>
