<h3 id="title-IDAPVIST" class="docSection1Title">25.3. HTTP</h3>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle2020"></a>In order to focus on security implications, we will not delve into all the details of HTTP and instead give a conceptual overview with emphasis on features that have security implications. If you want the details of HTTP, you should read RFC 2616. RESC01 gives a brief tutorial, and there are several books available such as GARF95 and STEI98.</p>
<p class="docText">The two main HTTP request types are <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">GET</span> and <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">POST</span>. The best way to think of them is that <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">GET</span> is for reading a web page and <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">POST</span> is for sending information to a web server. The response contains information such as the content requested and status information (such as OK or not found or unauthorized). One status that might be included in a response is a redirect. This informs the browser that it should go to a different URL. The browser will then go to the new URL, as if the user had clicked on a link.</p>
<p class="docText">A request header can contain other information, such as the language requested (e.g., English) or I<span class="docEmphSmaller">F</span>-M<span class="docEmphSmaller">ODIFIED</span>-S<span class="docEmphSmaller">INCE</span> (which indicates the time the cached copy was obtained, so that there would be no necessity of sending it again if it hadn't changed since then). Some of the information has security implications:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphSmaller">FROM</span>. The user's email address, which the browser can only know if the user has configured the browser to know this. This makes it very easy for a server to know which requests are coming from the same user, and which user it is (assuming the user has configured the email address as her real one). If you tell every web site what your email address is, you will wind up with lots of <span class="docEmphStrong">spam</span> (nuisance email), since the email addresses a site collects can be sold. There are also privacy concerns with automatically sending your email address, since you might want to browse information (such as medical information) anonymously. Browsers today do not fill in this field. However, there is a good use for this field. Spiders are supposed to put the email address of someone to contact in case the spider program misbehaves in some way.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphSmaller">AUTHORIZATION</span>. This field contains information that allows the server to know who the user is. It is sent by a browser to a server which in the past has replied to a request with a status indicating authentication is required. There are two types of authorization information: basic, which consists of the username and password base64-encoded, and digest (see &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch25lev1sec4.html#ch25lev1sec4">25.4</a> <span class="docEmphasis">HTTP Digest Authentication</span>). In either case, the browser needs to prompt the user for her name and password in order to fill in this field. Once she's done so, though, the browser caches the information and it won't be necessary for her to do so again. The name and password are server-specific, since the user might certainly have different names and passwords on different servers, so the browser must prompt the user for name and password each time a different server returns a status code indicating authentication is required.</p><p class="docList">Note that the name of this field should really be called <span class="docEmphSmaller">AUTHENTICATION</span> rather than <span class="docEmphSmaller">AUTHORIZATION</span>. The HTTP specification seems to use the two terms interchangeably, for variety perhaps. The field for specifying the method of authentication is known as WWW-<span class="docEmphSmaller">AUTHENTICATE</span>, but the field for carrying the information is known as <span class="docEmphSmaller">AUTHORIZATION</span> [see &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch25lev1sec4.html#ch25lev1sec4">25.4</a> <span class="docEmphasis">HTTP Digest Authentication</span>].</p></li><li><p class="docList">C<span class="docEmphSmaller">OOKIE</span>. This is a piece of data given to the client by the server, and returned by the client to the server in subsequent requests (see &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch25lev1sec5.html#ch25lev1sec5">25.5</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Cookies</span>).</p></li><li><p class="docList">R<span class="docEmphSmaller">EFERER</span>.<sup class="docFootnote"><a class="docLink" href="#ch25fn01">[*]</a></sup> The URL of the page from which the client came, either because the user explicitly clicked on a link, or because there was an embedded image pointing to this server.</p><blockquote><p class="docFootnote"><sup><a name="ch25fn01">[*]</a></sup> The name of the field is not our typo. Someone in the early days of the web misspelled <span class="docEmphasis">referrer</span>, and because it is included in the wire protocol, it has never been fixed for reasons of backward compatibility. Though maybe it's not a typo and was done to save 8 bits of bandwidth.</p></blockquote></li></ul>
