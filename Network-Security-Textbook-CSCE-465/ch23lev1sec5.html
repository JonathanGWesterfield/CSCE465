<h3 id="title-IDAGWZ5D" class="docSection1Title">23.5. Why Firewalls Don't Work</h3>
<p class="docText">Firewalls alone (without also doing end-to-end security) assume that all the bad guys are on the outside, and everyone inside can be completely trusted. This is, of course, an unwarranted assumption. Should employees have access (read and write) to the salary database, for instance?</p>
<p class="docText">Even if the company is so careful about hiring that no employee would ever do anything bad intentionally, firewalls can be defeated by somehow injecting malicious code into the corporate network. This can be done by tricking someone into downloading something from the Internet or launching an executable from an email message. It is quite common for an attacker to break into one system inside your firewall, and then use that system as a platform for attacking other systems. Someone once described firewall protected networks as &quot;hard and crunchy on the outside; soft and chewy on the inside&quot;.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1047"></a><a name="iddle1255"></a><a name="iddle1385"></a><a name="iddle1434"></a>Firewalls often make it difficult for legitimate users to get their work done. The firewall might be configured incorrectly, or not recognize a new legitimate application. And if the firewall allows anything through (say email or <span class="docEmphasis">http</span>), people figure out how to do what they need to do by disguising it as traffic that the firewall is configured to allow. File transfer is common by sending the file in email. To prevent this, some firewalls are configured to not allow very large email messages, in which case the users circumvent the firewall by breaking the file into small enough chunks, each chunk sent as a different email message. It's clumsy and annoying, but it works.</p>
<p class="docText">The ironic term for disguising traffic in order to fool a firewall is to carry your traffic in a <span class="docEmphStrong">firewall friendly</span> protocol. Since firewalls commonly allow <span class="docEmphasis">http</span> traffic (since it's the protocol used for browsing the web), there are many proposals for doing things over <span class="docEmphasis">http</span>, from network management to carrying IP over <span class="docEmphasis">http</span>, which would allow any traffic through! Firewall-friendly? The whole point is to defeat the best efforts of the firewall administrator to disallow what you are doing! It isn't somehow &quot;easier&quot; for the firewall to carry <span class="docEmphasis">http</span> traffic than any other. The easiest thing for the firewall would be to allow everything or nothing through!</p>
<p class="docText">Just as breaking a large file into lots of pieces to be individually carried in separate emails is inefficient, having protocols run on top of <span class="docEmphasis">http</span> rather than simply on top of IP is also inefficient in terms of bandwidth and computation.</p>
