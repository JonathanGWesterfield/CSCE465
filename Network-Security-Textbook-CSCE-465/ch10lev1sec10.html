<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Biometric devices sell best in places where users aren't afraid of technology or don't have a choice.</span></p>
<p class="docText">Â<span class="docEmphasis">Wall Street Journal</span>, Oct 13, 1992, William M. Bulkeley</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">In dividing authentication mechanisms into <span class="docEmphasis">what you know</span>, <span class="docEmphasis">what you have</span>, and <span class="docEmphasis">what you are</span>, biometric devices authenticate you according to <span class="docEmphasis">what you are</span>. They measure your physical characteristics and match them against a profile. You can't &quot;loan out&quot; anything that would help someone fool a biometric authentication device; nor can anything be stolen.</p>
<p class="docText">There are a variety of biometric devices available. All are too expensive to be in everyday use, but in some cases the costs are coming down to where we may see these. Technology available today includes:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Retinal scanner.</span> This is a device that examines the tiny blood vessels in the back of your eye. The layout is as distinctive as a fingerprint and apparently easier to read. These devices are quite expensive and have a &quot;psychologically threatening&quot; user interface.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Fingerprint readers.</span> This would seem an obvious technology since fingerprints have been used as a method of identification for many years. For some reason, automating this technology has never been very successful, though there are devices available.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Face recognition.</span> <a name="iddle1363"></a><a name="iddle1412"></a><a name="iddle1487"></a><a name="iddle1550"></a><a name="iddle2002"></a><a name="iddle2127"></a>Looking at a digitized picture of a person, a computer can measure facial dimensions and do a good job of recognizing people. Just don't show up at work with a black eye and a swollen jaw.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Iris scanner.</span> Like a retinal scanner, this maps the distinctive layout of the iris of your eye. It has the major advantage of having a less intimidating user interfaceÂrather than requiring you to look into a laser device, iris scans can be done with a camera several feet away and might even be done covertly.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Handprint readers.</span> These are more widely used than fingerprint readers. They measure the dimensions of the hand: finger length, width, and so on. They are not as accurate as fingerprints (more false positives), but they are less expensive and less problem-prone.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Voiceprints.</span> It turns out that it's possible to do a frequency spectrum analysis of someone's voice and get identification nearly as accurate as a fingerprint. This technology is in use, but has not caught on in spite of the fact that it should be fairly cheap. It can be defeated with a tape recording, and it may refuse to authenticate someone whose voice has shifted due to illness.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Keystroke timing.</span> The exact way in which people type is quite distinctive, and experiments have been done with identification based on the way people type. There is a problem that various injuries can throw off timing, and the networks that connect terminals and computers tend to lose the keystroke timing information before it reaches a processor that can use it.</p></li><li><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">Signatures.</span> These are a classic human form of authentication, and there are human experts quite adept at determining whether two signatures were produced by the same person. Machines thus far have not been able to duplicate that ability. However, when not just the signature is recorded, but the actual timing of the movements that go into scribing the signature, there is sufficient information for authentication, and some systems use this method, with the user signing on an electronic tablet.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">It might seem tempting to build a portable fingerprint reader as a peripheral to a laptop or PC that lets you stick your finger in and turns it into bits. Such devices are commercially available. The bits are then sent to a remote computer as a form of authentication. The problem with this approach is that the biometric properties cannot reasonably be kept secret. Anyone who knows your fingerprint can transmit the relevant fingerprint data. The only way in which a remote biometric device can be secure is if the device possesses a tamper-resistant secret and communicates with the remote computer via a cryptographically protected exchange.</p>
