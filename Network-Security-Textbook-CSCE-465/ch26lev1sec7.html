<h3 id="title-IDA3NCRH" class="docSection1Title">26.7. Use Different Keys for Signing vs. Encryption</h3>
<p class="docText">If a signature private key is forgotten, it's not a big deal. You can just generate a new one. But if an encryption private key is lost, you'd lose all the data encrypted with it. Therefore, it is common to err on the side of making it hard to lose the encryption key, by keeping extra copies of the private key, perhaps in lots of different places. But this makes the key easier to steal, a trade-off considered acceptable in some cases for an encryption key, given the high cost of losing all the encrypted data. But in most cases there's no advantage in keeping copies of a signature private key. It's better to make it less vulnerable to theft by not keeping copies.</p>
<p class="docText">Another reason for separate keys is for law enforcement or for a company that wants to be able to decrypt anything encrypted for any of its employees on any of its equipment. They would like the private encryption key readily accessible to people other than the person associated with that key. But they have no need to be able to forge something, so they do not need to have a copy of the person's signature private key. In fact, it's to their advantage not to have access to the signature key. Then the person cannot repudiate his signature on something, for instance, claiming that the death threat signed by his key was an attempt by law enforcement to frame him.</p>
<p class="docText">Yet another reason is that you'd like to treat old expired encryption keys differently than old signature keys. There's no reason to archive old private signature keys. Once the key is changed, just throw away the old one. Irretrievably discarding a private signature key once it isn't supposed to be used anymore safeguards against someone stealing the old key and backdating a document. But old encryption keys are likely to still be needed in order to decrypt data encrypted with them.</p>
