<h3 id="title-IDAPCJ1K" class="docSection1Title">21.4. Some PEM History</h3>
<p class="docText">The PEM Certificate Hierarchy is somewhat baroque, and to understand why it is the way it is, it helps to know some history. It got to where it is by a series of compromises, each one of which made sense in context. Although it never got deployed and at this point never will be, it is instructive to understand it as an example PKI design.</p>
<p class="docText">The original vision for the PEM Certificate Hierarchy was to have a large number of independently operated CAs, each having responsibility for a subtree of the global namespace. Most X.500 names would list individuals as members of an organization, and it seemed natural for the organization to operate the CA for its own members. For instance, the organization CIA might have a CA called <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">/C=US/O=CIA</span>, and all the names of people in CIA start out with the string <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">/C=US/O=CIA</span>, for example <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">/C=US/O=CIA/CN=Noriega</span>. If an organization was large, it might create subsidiary CAs and delegate to them control of sub-parts of the organization's name space. For instance, there might be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">/C=US/O=CIA/OU=plumbers</span>. Someone who worked in that organization would then have a name like <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">/C=US/O=CIA/OU=plumbers/CN=Liddy</span>. A single global root CA would certify the names and public keys of all the independent organizations. To be considered valid by the recipient, a certificate would have to follow the rule that the <span class="docEmphStrong">issuer name</span> (the name of the CA that signs the certificate) be a prefix of the <span class="docEmphStrong">subject name</span> (the name of the owner of the public key being certified). This would guarantee that a CA in one organization could not issue a valid certificate for a user in another. So for instance, with the certificate for Liddy, the issuer name would be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">/C=US/O=CIA/OU=plumbers</span> and the subject name would be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">/C=US/O=CIA/OU=plumb-ers/CN=Liddy</span>. (Note that PEM allows a CA to certify anything in its subtree, so the CA for <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">/C=US/O=CIA</span> would be allowed to issue a certificate for <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">/C=US/O=CIA/OU=plumb-ers/CN=Liddy</span>.)</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1833"></a>PEM was intended to be deployed in the free-wheeling internet community where it would replace a system with virtually no security at all. The vision was for PEM to open up new applications by offering a single uniformly high standard of authentication. It might, for example, be possible to sign purchase orders as PEM messages and consider them legally binding. And it should be possible to send an encrypted message to someone around the world with complete confidence that only the intended recipient would be able to read it. Such confidence requires faith in both the cryptographic mechanisms used and the operational procedures of the people who create certificates. If there are &quot;sloppy&quot; CAs around who will issue certificates to anyone with an honest face, how can you know who is really sending and reading your messages?</p>
<p class="docText">The original vision for PEM, therefore, set a uniformly high standard for the operational procedures of CAs. Since the compromise of a CA's key would be particularly disastrous, it would be required that CAs be implemented in specially packaged hardware that made it nearly impossible to extract the CA's private key from the hardware. Strict administrative rules would be followed in qualifying the people who could operate the CAs and in the procedures they would follow in ensuring that they issued certificates only to people who had adequately proven their identities.</p>
<p class="docText">The root CA would be particularly sensitive, since its compromise would render the entire PEM infrastructure useless. The PEM designers assumed the root CA would be operated by an organization that would use draconian procedures to protect the integrity of its private key and its signing procedures. Since there would be no way to change the root key, whichever organization was chosen to be the root would have an eternal monopoly. RSADSI (the organization that licensed the RSA patent) was positioning itself to be that organization.</p>
<p class="docText">This structure had a side effect that it made possible a licensing structure and mechanism for RSADSI to collect fees for issuing certificates, and once this mechanism was sufficiently entrenched, it would allow them to continue to collect fees for certificates even after the RSA patent expired. The same CA hardware that protects the CA's private key could also act as a &quot;postage meter&quot; which keeps track of the number of certificates it issues and can require payment of a per-certificate fee to RSADSI. Collection of royalties is therefore distributed. RSADSI could enforce the use of metering hardware (or some alternative royalty arrangement) by refusing to certify an organizational CA until some accommodation was reached. Without such an organizational certificate, the certificates issued by a CA would not be accepted by &quot;standard&quot; PEM implementations.</p>
<p class="docText">This vision of the PEM certificate hierarchy was ultimately rejected by the IETF standards community for a number of reasons.</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">Universities were not amenable to enforcing the same administrative procedures for authenticating their students as defense contractors were in authenticating their employees. No &quot;one size fits all&quot; compromise could be reached. It may have been discussions of mandatory drug testing for CA operators that pushed this over the edge.</p></li><li><p class="docList"><a name="iddle1134"></a><a name="iddle1468"></a><a name="iddle1479"></a><a name="iddle1786"></a><a name="iddle1829"></a>There were concerns about the availability and cost of the CA hardware. For several years, organizational certificates and the hardware remained &quot;a few months&quot; away.</p></li><li><p class="docList">There was reluctance to trust RSADSIÂor any single partyÂwith the security of the entire system.</p></li><li><p class="docList">There was a reluctance to expand the RSADSI monopoly. RSADSI was the sole licensing authority for the RSA algorithm, so it might seem that it was necessary to make peace with them in order to use PEM, but this was simplistic. The U.S. Government had rights to use the algorithm without payment of royalties. Several companies had already reached agreements with RSADSI and were afraid of having to &quot;pay again&quot;. RSA was only patented within the U.S., and foreign concerns were afraid of having to pay for what they currently used for free. And since the RSA patent would expire on September 20, 2000, people were not happy about the possibility of having to continue to pay RSADSI after that date in order to obtain certificates.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">In any case, it was decided that this relatively straightforward solution to the certificate hierarchy was unacceptable, and the designers embellished it in the minimal fashion that workedÂthey added another layer to the hierarchy and explicitly allowed people to go into competition with RSADSI. The result is the hierarchy we're about to describe.</p>
