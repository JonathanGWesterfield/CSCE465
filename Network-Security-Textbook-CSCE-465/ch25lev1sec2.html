<h3 id="title-IDAEFPYT" class="docSection1Title">25.2. URLs/URIs</h3>
<p class="docText">URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a term that is used to mean either a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or a URN (Uniform Resource Name). In reality the only UR things you'll trip over are URLs, so it's reasonable (though perhaps politically incorrect) to use the terms URI and URL interchangeably. The more familiar term is URL, so that's what we'll use, though some of the HTTP fields use the term URI.</p>
<p class="docText">A URL is what you type into your browser, and what appears in the HTML source on a link. It looks something like this:</p>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphRomanAlt"><a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.domainname.com/info_that_the_server_will__use_however_it_wants">http://www.domainname.com/info_that_the_server_will__use_however_it_wants</a></span></p>
<p class="docText">To the left of the initial &quot;://&quot; is the name of the protocol to be used, in this case HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol), which is the primary protocol for browsing the web. It could be something else, such as ftp. The next component (<span class="docEmphRomanAlt"><a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.domainname.com">www.domainname.com</a></span>) is the DNS name of the server. This is what will be looked up in DNS to find the IP address the client should contact. The fact that most URLs contain a server name that starts with &quot;<span class="docEmphRomanAlt">www.</span>&quot; has nothing to do with the standards. It is just a convention that evolved. A particular site would own a domain name such as dec.com, and have perhaps lots of machines with names such as <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">rabbit.dec.com</span>, <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">tiger.dec.com</span>, <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">panther.dec.com</span>. (Often departments within companies choose &quot;theme&quot; names to come up with unique names for their machines within the company. So one department might name their machines after authors of great literature, and another after characters on Star Trek.) Another method of ensuring unique names for machines within the company is to add an extra level of hierarchy to the name, such as giving all machines in the U.S. names that end in us.dec.com. Then names of machines would look like <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">happy.us.dec.com</span>, <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">grumpy.us.dec.com</span>, etc., and the U.S. branches of the company would not have to coordinate with branches in other countries to ensure unique machine names, since there would be no ambiguity between the machines <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">happy.us.dec.com</span> and <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">happy.oz.dec.com</span>. The name <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">www</span> is conventionally the name of the machine that is accessible to the outside world for connecting to via HTTP and obtaining web content. Since companies that are posting content generally want it to be easy to find, the web content for dec.com is likely to be on the machine <a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.dec.com">www.dec.com</a>. If it were instead on a machine called <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">arachnid.us.dec.com</span>, users are unlikely to be able to guess or remember the URL.</p>
<p class="docText">In place of the server name, it is legal to put an IP address. The 32-bit IP address is represented with the traditional dotted decimal representation, such as <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">10.241.88.3</span>, where each component is the decimal representation of one of the 4 octets of the IP address.</p>
<p class="docText">Some URLs allow embedding account names in front of the server name, in the format <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">username@</span>. For instance, the URL specification would consider <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">http://radia@us.dec.com</span> to be a perfectly valid URL. But the HTTP specification (RFC 2616) would not consider that URL as valid, because HTTP forbids user names embedded in its URLs. Most browsers, faced with a URL that contains a username field just throw away the username portion and use the rest of the URL when making an HTTP request, rather than complaining to the user that the URL is illegal. This is relevant because users can be tricked with complex-looking URLs (see &sect;<a class="docLink" href="ch25lev1sec6.html#ch25lev2sec4">25.6.1</a> <span class="docEmphasis">Spoofing a Site to a User</span>).</p>
<p class="docText">URLs also allow specification of the user's password in the URL. The user's password, if present, appears after the username and before the <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">@</span>, separated from the user name with a colon as in <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">radia:AsIfI'dPrintMyPasswordInABook</span>. Although HTTP doesn't allow the username and password information, FTP does use it. A URL such as</p>
<blockquote><p></p><p class="docList"><span class="docEmphRomanAlt">ftp://radia:AsIfI'dPrintMyPasswordInABook@happy.us.dec.com/int/bookfile.ps</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">would indicate that the protocol to be used is FTP, and the login information to FTP would consist of <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">radia</span> as the username, and <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">AsIfI'dPrintMyPasswordInABook</span> as the password. After the first single slash appears <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">int/bookfile.ps</span>, which indicates the file <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">bookfile.ps</span> on the directory <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">int/</span> on machine <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">happy.us.dec.com</span>.</p>
<p class="docText">Another thing that can appear in a URL is the layer 4 (TCP) port number. If present, it follows the server name and a colon separator, as in <span class="docEmphRomanAlt"><a class="docLink" target="_blank" href="http://happy.us.dec.com:626/int/bookfile.ps">http://happy.us.dec.com:626/int/bookfile.ps</a></span>, which would indicate port 626. In the case of HTTP, if no port is specified, the default is port 80.</p>
