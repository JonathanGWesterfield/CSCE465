<h3 id="title-IDAFMP1" class="docSection1Title">10.6. Passwords and Careless Users</h3>
<p class="docText">At a lecture on computer security, a professor asked, &quot;Are there any advantages of passwords over biometric devices?&quot; A helpful student replied &quot;When you want to let someone use your account, with a password you just give it to them, while with a biometric device you have to go with them until they are logged in.&quot; This is the sort of remark that sends chills down the back of security administrators and makes them think of their users as adversaries rather than the customers they are trying to protect. Security people need to remember that most people regard security as a nuisance rather than as needed protection, and left to their own devices they often carelessly give up the security that someone worked so hard to provide. The solution is to educate users on the importance of security, helping them to understand the reasons for the procedures they are asked to follow, and making those procedures sufficiently tolerable that they don't develop contempt for the process.</p>
<p class="docText">Passwords are particularly easy to abuse. The classic tale is one where the system manager's password is posted on the console because it is too long and complex to remember.</p>
<p class="docText">One particular danger is users' including passwords on-line in accessible places. In addition to doing this as a substitute for little black books, users might find it convenient to include passwords in scripts used to automate access to other systems, or they might include passwords in messages sent via electronic mail. Electronic mail messages are frequently archived. Both schemes allow an attacker who has gotten into one account to cascade those rights into other accounts on other systems.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAXMP1" class="docSection2Title">10.6.1. Using a Password in Multiple Places</h4>
<p class="docText">One of the tough trade-offs is whether to recommend that users use the same password in multiple places or keep their passwords different for different systems. All things being equal, use of different passwords is more secure because if one password is compromised it only gives away the user's rights on a single system. Things are rarely equal, however. When weighed against the likelihood that users will resort to writing passwords down if they need to remember more than one, the trade-off is less clear.</p>
<p class="docText">An issue that weighs in favor of different passwords is that of a cascaded break-in. An attacker that breaks in to one system may succeed in reading the password database. If users have different passwords on different systems, this information will be of no use. But if passwords are common, a break-in to a system that was not well protected because it contained no &quot;important&quot; information might in fact leak passwords that are useful on critical systems.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAFNP1" class="docSection2Title">10.6.2. Requiring Frequent Password Changes</h4>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">Security is a wet blanket.</span></p>
<p class="docText">Âapologies to Charles Schulz</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">A technique that offers some security but is probably overused, is requiring frequent password changes. The idea behind frequent password changes is that if someone does learn your password, it will only be useful until it next changes. This protection may not be worth much if a lot of damage can be done in a short time.</p>
<p class="docText">The problem with requiring frequent password changes is that users are more likely to write passwords down and less likely to give much thought or creativity to choosing them. The result is observable and guessable passwords. It's also true that users tend to circumvent password change policy unless enforcement is clever. In a spy-vs.-spy escalation, the following is a common scenario:</p>
<div style="font-weight:bold"><ol class="docList" type="1"><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The system administrator decides that passwords must be changed every 90 days, and the system enforces this.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The user types the change password command, resetting the password to the same thing as before.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The system administrator discovers users are doing this and modifies the system so that it makes sure the password, when changed, is set to a different value.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The user then does a change password procedure that sets the password to something new, and then immediately sets it back to the old, familiar value.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList"><a name="iddle1768"></a><a name="iddle2096"></a>The system administrator then has the system keep track of the previous <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> password values and does not allow the password to be set to any of them.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The user then does a change password procedure that goes through <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> different password values and finally, on the <span class="docEmphasis">n</span>+1<sup>st</sup> password change, returns the password to its old familiar value.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The system is modified to keep track of the last time the password was changed and does not allow another password change for some number of days.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The user, when forced to change passwords, constructs a new password by appending '1' to the end of the previous password. Next time the user replaces the '1' with a '2', ...</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The system, in looking for guessable passwords, looks for passwords that look &quot;too much like&quot; one of the previous <span class="docEmphasis">n</span> passwords.</p></div></li><li><div style="font-weight:normal"><p class="docList">The users throw up their hands in disgust, accept impossible-to-remember passwords, and post them on their terminals.</p></div></li></ol></div>
<p class="docText">All of these techniques have been tried on some system or another. In general, it's impossible to make systems secure without the cooperation of the legitimate users. If frequent password changes address a real threat, users must be educated to fear that threat so they will strive for good passwords. If the threat cannot be made real to the users, the inconvenience won't be worth the trouble.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAEQP1" class="docSection2Title">10.6.3. A Login Trojan Horse to Capture Passwords</h4>
<p class="docText">A threat as old as timesharing is to leave a program running on a public terminal that displays a login prompt. An unsuspecting user then enters a user name and password. The Trojan horse program logs the name and password to a file before the program terminates in some way designed to minimize suspicion. There is no protection from this threat given a sufficiently naive user. Approaches toward minimizing it are based on making it difficult for a program to &quot;look like&quot; a normal login prompt. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">On some systems, any program request for input is preceded by an automatically inserted '?'. If the real login prompt is made to have no '?', a program can't produce a believable counterfeit.</p></li><li><p class="docList">On the bit-mapped screens associated with workstations and X-windows terminals, the login screen takes up the entire screen and has no border. If the protocol prevents ordinary programs from displaying such a screen, they can't counterfeit a login prompt very reasonably.</p></li><li><p class="docList">On most systems, there is some way to interrupt running programs. Training users to enter the interrupt key sequence before logging in would then thwart such Trojan horses. For example, newer Windows systems require the user to type Ctrl-Alt-Delete as part of the login sequence. In (almost) any scenario other than a login prompt, this key sequence would interrupt a running program. Unfortunately, many systems allow programs to disable interrupts; for those systems, this technique would not be useful.</p></li></ul>
<p class="docText">Even if the Trojan horse program can do the login prompt exactly, it might not be able to exactly duplicate the way the system behaves after a user logs in. This will make an alert user suspicious. For example:</p>
<ul><li><p class="docList">A reasonable action following the capture of a password is to log it, put out the message the user would get if the password were mistyped, and then terminate and return to a regular login prompt. The user will assume the password was mistyped the first time and try again. This can be prevented if a program can't end its session without a logout banner. Such a banner before the second login message is a dead giveaway. Mentioned earlier was having a message displayed at login telling users the number of unsuccessful login attempts to the account since the last successful attempt. This doubles as Trojan horse protection because the successful login would not report that there had just been a failed login attempt.</p></li><li><p class="docList">Another thing the Trojan horse program can do is hang after accepting the user's name and password, as if the system had gotten into a wedged state. If the program can prevent the user from using any escape characters, the user will just get frustrated and reboot or reconnect. Given how accustomed we all have become to the flakiness of our computers, very few users would find this behavior suspicious.</p></li><li><p class="docList">An optimally designed Trojan horse would actually use the username and password to log the user in and run a session. Some operating systems offer sufficient modularity and generality to make this possible. It would be a security feature to make this evident to processes started in non-standard ways so that some sort of warning banner could be displayed.</p></li></ul>

<h4 id="title-IDARRP1" class="docSection2Title">10.6.4. Non-Login Use of Passwords</h4>
<p class="docText">Entering a single password to log into a system and subsequently having access to all the user's resources is, in most environments, a reasonable mix of security and convenience. It's not the only way to do it. Some systems permit password protection on individual files. A user could specially protect certain files so that someone learning the user's login password still couldn't get at those files.</p>
<p class="docText">Similarly, applications could require their own authentication of a user before permitting access to certain databases (even after the user has logged in).</p>
