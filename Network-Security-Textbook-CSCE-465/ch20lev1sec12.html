<h3 id="title-IDAIP4YK" class="docSection1Title">20.12. Anonymity</h3>
<p class="docText">There are times when Alice might want to send Bob a message, but not have Bob be able to tell who sent the message. One might think that would be easy. Alice could merely not sign the message. However, most mail systems automatically include the sender's name in the mail message. One <a name="iddle1832"></a>could imagine modifying one's mailer to leave out that information, but a clever recipient can get clues. For instance, the network layer address of the node from which it was sent might be sent with the message. Often the node from which the recipient receives the message is not the actual source, but instead is an intermediate node that stores and forwards mail. However, most mail transports include a record of the path the message took, and this information might be available to the recipient.</p>
<p class="docText">If Alice really wants to ensure anonymity, she can use the same technique as for message flow confidentiality. She can give the message to a third party, Fred, and have Fred send the unsigned message on to Bob.</p>
<p class="docText">If Fred does not have enough clients, he can't really provide anonymity. For instance, if Alice is the only one who has sent a message to Fred, then Bob can guess the message came from her, even if Fred is sending out lots of messages to random people. Fred can have lots of clients by providing other, innocuous services, such as weather reports, bookmaking, or pornographic screen savers (where you are required to transmit a fixed-length, encrypted message in order to get a response), or by having the user community cooperate by sending dummy messages to Fred at random intervals to provide cover for someone who might really require the service. (We specified fixed-length messages to Fred so that people could not correlate the lengths of messages into and out of FredÂsomeone wanting to send a longer message would have to break it into multiple messages, and pad short messages.)</p>
<p class="docText">There's an amusing anecdote about anonymous mail. Someone does provide an anonymous mail service. The way it works is you send an ordinary mail message to the service, telling it to whom you'd like to send an anonymous message. It strips off your real address and substitutes a pseudonym for you. The first time you send a message it assigns you a pseudonym, but on subsequent messages it fills in the same pseudonym. So people won't know from whom the message came, but they'll know that different messages came from the same person. Mail sent to any of the pseudonyms assigned by the anonymity service will be directed to that service, which will substitute the real address instead of the destination's pseudonym (and incidentally, assign a pseudonym to the source and substitute thatÂthis particular service didn't allow for non-anonymous mail to be sent to a pseudonym).</p>
<p class="docText">Anyway, one December day in 1993, someone decided to add him/herself to the IETF mailing list as the pseudonym assigned by the service. Then someone sent a message to the IETF mailing list (it happens). When the message was distributed by the mailing list, it was sent to all the members, including the pseudonym. When this pseudonym-addressed copy was received by the anonymous mail service, it assigned a pseudonym to the source (the mailing list) and sent an assignment message back to the mailing list, which of course got distributed to all the mailing list members:</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1205"></a><a name="iddle1596"></a><a name="iddle2056"></a>This strange behavior was caused by the anonymity service's assumption that both parties using its service would want anonymity, which is not a reasonable assumption. It should be possible for two anonymous parties to communicate, but it is also reasonable for a non-anonymous party to communicate with an anonymous party. A pseudonym should not be assigned unless requested.</p>
