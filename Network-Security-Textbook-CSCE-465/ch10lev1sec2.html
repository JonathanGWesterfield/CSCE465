<h3 id="title-IDAIXBFO" class="docSection1Title">10.2. On-Line Password Guessing</h3>
<p class="docText">I can impersonate you if I can guess your password. And that might not be hard. I<sub>2</sub> once heard someone remark, about a faculty member at a major university, that &quot;although in all other respects she appears to be a sentient human being, she insists on using her first name as her password.&quot; On some systems, passwords are administratively set to a fixed attribute of a person, such as their birthday or their badge number. This makes passwords easy to remember and distribute, but it also makes them easy to guess. I<sub>1</sub> once worked on a system where students' passwords were administratively set to their first and last initials. Faculty accounts were considered more sensitive, so they were protected with <span class="docEmphasis">three</span> initials.</p>
<p class="docText">An astonishing number of banks allow Internet access based on your account number and a password, and they set initial passwords to the last four digits of your Social Security Number. In many states in the U.S., it is the local custom to use your Social Security Number as your driver's license number, and to use your driver's license as identification for cashing checks. That means cashiers can easily get your account number (from the front of the check) and your social security number (from the driver's license). It is surprising there has been so little fraud based on this poor design.</p>
<p class="docText">Even if passwords are chosen so they are not obvious, they may be guessable if the impostor gets enough guesses. In fact, given enough guesses, any password, no matter how carefully chosen, can be guessed (by enumerating all finite character sequences until you hit on the correct password). Whether this is feasible depends on how many guesses it takes and how rapidly passwords can be tested.</p>
<p class="docText">In the military use of passwords, guessing is not a problem. You show up at the door. You utter a word. If it's the right word, they let you in; if it's the wrong word, they shoot you. Even if you know the password is the month in which the general was born, guessing is not an attractive pursuit.</p>
<p class="docText">Most terminals do not have an &quot;execute user&quot; function controllable from the remote end (as useful as that might be), so this mechanism for limiting password guessing is not available. Given that people's fingers slip or they forget that they changed their password, it's important that they get more than one chance anyway. There are ways to limit the number or rate of guesses. The first is to design the system so that guesses have to actually be typed by a human. Computers are much faster and more patient than people at making guesses, so the threat is much greater if the impostor can get a computer to do the dirty work. Before the days of networks and PCs, this just meant that operating systems needed to ensure that they got passwords from terminals rather than programs. But now that login requests can come in over networks and lots of terminals are really PCs emulating terminals, there's really no way to prevent this.</p>
<p class="docText">One seemingly attractive mechanism for preventing password guessing is to keep track of the number of consecutive incorrect passwords for an account and when the number exceeds a threshold, say five, &quot;lock&quot; the account and refuse access, even with a correct password, until the system is administratively reset. This technique is used with PINs on ATM cardsÂthree wrong guesses and the machine eats your card. You have to show up at the bank with ID to get it back. An important downside of this approach is that a computer vandal (someone who simply wants to annoy people and disrupt operations) can, possibly with the aid of a computer, guess five bad passwords against all the accounts on a system and lock them all up, effectively shutting the system down until it is administratively reset (assuming it can be administratively reset when all of the administrators' accounts are locked!). This represents little work for the vandal and can cause serious disruption. So this approach is unacceptable in most environments.</p>
<p class="docText">Another approach to slow down a guesser is to only allow a limited number of account/password guesses per connection attempt. If the system is based on dialing in via modem or restarting a big slow application, the overhead of having to restart for each five attempts can slow down the guessing rate considerably (even with an auto-dial modem). A variant on this theme is simply to have incorrect passwords (or even all passwords) be processed s l o w l y .</p>
<p class="docText">If you can't prevent guessing, maybe you can catch the guesser. By auditing invalid password attempts, a system manager can be alerted to the fact that an attempt is being made to penetrate the system. It might then be possible to try to trace the connection or take other corrective action. False alarms in audit logs can be prevented by filtering out the common case where a user mistypes a password and then immediately thereafter types it correctly. Events where a password fails and the connection then switches to a different account or disconnects are substantially more suspicious. A method for distributing the detective work is for systems to report to users when they log in the time of their previous login and the number of unsuccessful password attempts since the last successful login. In practice, few users will check the time of last successful login to see whether it looks right, but most will notice reports of failed login attempts if they did not mistype the password themselves. This doesn't work for &quot;stale&quot; accounts that the user never logs into. Such accounts are subject to other threats as well; it's good security policy to eliminate accounts not in regular use.</p>
<p class="docText">The expected time to guess a password is the expected number an impostor has to guess before getting it right divided by the guess rate. So far, we've concentrated on limiting the rate of password guesses. Another promising approach is to ensure that the number of passwords an attacker would need to search is large enough to be secure against an off-line, unaudited search with a lot of CPU power. If passwords are randomly chosen eight-character strings made from the characters <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">a</span>Â<span class="docEmphRomanAlt">z</span>, then even if an attacker could guess a password every millisecond, it would take (on average) over three years to guess it. This would make all the more obtrusive and expensive preventive mechanisms unnecessary. Some administrations assign such passwords (randomly chosen 8-character strings). These systems have another problem:</p>
<p class="docText">Users hate them...and forget them...and write them down. As discussed later, when users write down passwords rather than memorizing them, a whole new class of threats open up. Many otherwise fine minds are genetically incapable of memorizing randomly chosen eight-character passwords. Sometimes the random password generator is clever enough to generate pronounceable strings, which makes it a little easier for the human to remember the password. Constraining the generated passwords to pronounceable strings of the same length limits the number of possible passwords by at least an order of magnitude, but since a 10-character pronounceable string is probably easier to remember than an 8-character completely random string, and is about as secure, generating pronounceable strings is a good idea if the administrator wants to impose passwords.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1059"></a><a name="iddle1726"></a>A better approach is to let users choose their own passwords but to warn them to choose &quot;good&quot; ones and enforce that choice where possible. Usually the best combination of memorability and difficulty of guessing is a &quot;pass-phrase&quot; with intentional misspelling or punctuation and odd capitalization, like <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">GoneFi$hing</span> or <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">MyPassworDisTuff!</span>, or the first letter of each word of a phrase, like <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">Mhall;Ifwwas</span> (Mary had a little lamb; Its fleece was white as snow).</p>
<p class="docText">The program that lets users set passwords should check for easy-to-guess passwords and disallow them. It might, for example, run them through a spell-checking dictionary and reject them if they are spelled correctly! (A favorite attack is to guess all the words in a dictionary as passwords; a large dictionary might contain 500000 words, and it is not difficult to check that many.) If possible, the dictionary should be extended with common first and last names. The program could also require mixed cases, non-alphabetic characters, a minimum length, and a minimum number of different characters.</p>
<p class="docText">Surprisingly, most variants of UNIX limit password length to eight characters (or more precisely, they only check the first eight). VMS allows long passwords, and allows the administrator to set policies such as how long they must be, how often they must be changed, and how many old passwords the system remembers in order to prevent a user from reusing an old password.</p>
