<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1360"></a><a name="iddle1804"></a><a name="iddle1839"></a><a name="iddle1937"></a><a name="iddle2145"></a>PGP is another secure mail protocol. It started out as a single public-domain implementation that was, in the words of Phil Zimmermann, the original author, <span class="docEmphasis">guerrilla freeware</span>. It was the author's intention that it be distributed widely (anyone with a copy is invited to send copies to friends; copies can also be obtained from a bunch of Internet FTP sites). Unfortunately, both RSADSI, by enforcing the RSA patent, and government authorities, by enforcing export control of dangerous technologies like nuclear weapons and the ability to encrypt mail, caused PGP to start its life as contraband. Its history is colorful, serving as a test case in a number of legal challenges to U.S. export laws. We recommend GARF95 as an entertaining and informative telling of its early history and use. Ironically, PGP has been, from the start, legal and freely available in many other countries because the RSA patent is U.S.-only and other governments have different policies about the export, import, and use of privacy protection technology. For a while, the most popular site distributing PGP over the Internet was in Finland. Finland is very liberal about cryptography (but is still snitty about selling nuclear weapons, we presume).</p>
<p class="docText">The PGP documentation is delightfully conspiratorial and fun to read. Phil starts out by asserting that although we honest people don't really think we need to encrypt our emailÂwe're not hiding anythingÂwe should all start encrypting our mail so that in case someone needs privacy, the poor soul won't arouse suspicion by being the only one encrypting mail. Phil uses the analogy with paper mail. If the &quot;standard&quot; scheme were to write everything on postcards, and then only in unusual cases where you felt you didn't want the government or the next door neighbor reading your mail would you enclose it in an envelope, then a letter in an envelope would arouse suspicion and save the snooper timeÂevery letter in an envelope would probably contain something interesting to the snooper. The questionable legality of PGP inspired a cult following, with people using it as a statement in support of personal freedoms and geek pride, independent of any need for secrecy.</p>

<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.</span></p>
<p class="docText">ÂPhil Zimmermann</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">In trying to accommodate patents, export laws, a desire for commercialization, and committees of people trying to help, PGP has unfortunately evolved into a Tower of Babel. PGP Classic (Version 2.6.*) gained a large user community using the RSA and IDEA encryption algorithms. Through arduous negotiations, one version (2.6.2) became legal for non-commercial use within the U.S. and was freely downloadable from an MIT web site. And it was possible to buy a license making it legally usable for any purpose. Not satisfied with that, an incompatible PGP using patent-free algorithms (DSS, Diffie-Hellman, and Triple DES) was developed. It also avoided U.S. export law by a novel mechanism. U.S. export law covers software, but not books (books existed when the first amendment was drafted, but the Internet did not). The source code for PGP was published as a book, the book was legally exported from the U.S., and then someone outside the U.S. optically scanned the book and turned it back into software outside the U.S. In large part to publicly embarrass the export authorities, the book was published in an OCR font (a font designed for Optical Character Recognition before scanners became good enough to accurately scan almost any font) and digital checksums were included on each page. Surprisingly, the book also sold well to the public, who bought it either out of ignorance or to be able to display a great hack. This had the potential for getting PGP out from under patent and export restrictions, but it fragmented the user community (since the two versions could not interoperate).</p>
<p class="docText">In trying to harness the market buzz around &quot;Open Software&quot;, the internal data representations of PGP were redesigned by an IETF committee and dubbed &quot;Open PGP&quot;. Several independent (and not always interoperating) versions of Open PGP have been deployed including one called GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard). While all of this was going on, the RSA patent expired in September 2000 potentially making PGP Classic finally legal for all uses everywhere. Unfortunately, a patent on the IDEA algorithm that expires in 2007 has postponed that possibility. The formats described in the remainder of this chapter are for PGP Classic. The newer ones are more complex, but similar in spirit and goals.</p>
