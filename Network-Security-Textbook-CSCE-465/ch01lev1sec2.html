<h3 id="title-IDA1TEFE" class="docSection1Title">1.2. What Type of Book Is This?</h3>
<p class="docText">We believe the reason most computer science is hard to understand is because of jargon and irrelevant details. When people work with something long enough they invent their own language, come up with some meta-architectural framework or other, and forget that the rest of the world doesn't talk or think that way. We intend this book to be reader-friendly. We try to extract the concepts and <a name="iddle2055"></a>ignore the meta-architectural framework, since whatever a meta-architectural framework is, it's irrelevant to what something does and how it works.</p>
<p class="docText">We believe someone who is a relative novice to the field ought to be able to read this book. But readability doesn't mean lack of technical depth. We try to go beyond the information one might find in specifications. The goal is not just to describe exactly how the various standards and de facto standards work, but to explain why they are the way they are, why some protocols designed for similar purposes are different, and the implications of the design decisions. Sometimes engineering tradeoffs were made. Sometimes the designers could have made better choices (they are human after all), in which case we explain how the protocol could have been better. This analysis should make it easier to understand the current protocols, and aid in design of future protocols.</p>
<p class="docText">The primary audience for this book is engineers, especially those who might need to evaluate the security of, or add security features to, a distributed system; but the book is also intended to be usable as a textbook, either on the advanced undergraduate or graduate level. Most of the chapters have homework problems at the end.</p>
<p class="docText">Not all the chapters will be of interest to all readers. In some cases we describe and critique a standard in great detail. These chapters might not be of interest to students or people trying to get a conceptual understanding of the field. But in many cases the standards are written fairly unintelligibly. People who need to understand the standard, perhaps to implement it, or maybe even to use it, need to have a place where it is described in a readable way (and we strive for readability), but also a place in which mistakes in the standard are pointed out as such. It's very difficult to understand why, for instance, two fields are included which both give the same information. Sometimes it is because the designers of the protocol made a mistake. Once something like that is pointed out as a simple mistake, it's much easier to understand the specification. We hope that reading the descriptions in the book will make the specifications more intelligible.</p>
