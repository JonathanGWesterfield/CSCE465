<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1292"></a><a name="iddle1295"></a><a name="iddle1496"></a><a name="iddle1721"></a><a name="iddle2005"></a>While SKIP and Photuris proponents were fighting with each other, ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol, RFC 2408) emerged, a gift to the IETF from the NSA. ISAKMP wasn't a protocol but was a framework in which fields could be exchanged to create a protocol. It is specified as running over UDP rather than TCP, and is woefully underspecified on issues such as what happens when messages get lost. Given how thrilled IETF usually is at anything having to do with the NSA, and given how ISAKMP didn't actually <span class="docEmphasis">do</span> anything, it was astonishing that the IETF embraced it and decided that IPsec would somehow have to operate within the ISAKMP framework. Adopting ISAKMP gave an excuse not to adopt either SKIP or Photuris, because once the requirement of working with ISAKMP was assumed, neither protocol met that requirement.</p>
<p class="docText">Another document was written, supposedly as a protocol that would work within the ISAKMP framework, and that was called OAKLEY (RFC 2412). Another proposal was SKEME <a class="docLink" href="biblio01.html#biblio01_097">[KRAW96]</a>. Then IKE (RFC 2409) was written, crediting ideas from OAKLEY and SKEME, and using ISAKMP syntax. But even at that it was incomplete, and there's another document, <span class="docEmphasis">The Internet IP Security Domain of Interpretation for ISAKMP</span> (RFC 2407) that defines a lot of the fields. ISAKMP's idea of a <span class="docEmphStrong">domain of interpretation</span> (<span class="docEmphStrong">DOI</span>) is that a DOI specifies a particular use of ISAKMP, and the intention is that for each DOI value there would be a specification that would define what all the parameters mean for that DOI value. So you need RFCs 2407, 2408, and 2409 in order to know how to implement IKE.</p>
<p class="docText">The distinction between IKE and ISAKMP is very confusing. Probably the best way to think of it is that IKE is a profiling (i.e., defining fields, choosing options) of ISAKMP, but it isn't that straightforward. The impression is that the IKE authors attempted to make their document self-contained but ran out of energy and deferred to the ISAKMP spec for encodings. The terms tend to be used inconsistently, adding to the confusion. For instance, a direct quote from the IKE spec (RFC 2409):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="docText"><span class="docEmphasis">While Oakley defines &quot;modes&quot;, ISAKMP defines &quot;phases&quot;. The relationship between the two is very straightforward and IKE presents different exchanges as modes which operate in one of two phases.</span></p>
<p class="docText">ÂRFC 2409</p></blockquote>
<p class="docText">Imagine trying to read 150 pages of this (80 for ISAKMP, 30 for DOI document, and 40 for IKE), and you'll see why ISAKMP/IKE never got much scrutiny, though miraculously, people were able to implement it and even interoperate. In the next sections we'll describe the protocols conceptually, together with an analysis of them and suggestions for improvement.</p>
