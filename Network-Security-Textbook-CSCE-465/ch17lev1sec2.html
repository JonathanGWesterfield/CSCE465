<h3 id="title-IDAS2QRX" class="docSection1Title">17.2. IP and IPv6</h3>
<p class="docText">IP is what's known in ISO terminology as a <span class="docEmphasis">network layer</span>, or <span class="docEmphasis">layer 3</span> protocol. It puts a source address and destination address on data, much like addressing an envelope to be sent through snail mail. IP was designed with 32-bit addresses, and many people started to realize in the mid-1980s that 32 bits was too few. There were other layer 3 protocols deployed at the time with adequate address space, and the IETF could have adopted one of those. In fact, in 1992, the IAB (Internet Architecture Board) recommended replacing IP with the CLNP packet format, a format that was very similar to IP, but had larger addresses. CLNP had been standardized by ISO and implemented by most of the vendors.</p>
<p class="docText">If the IETF had adopted CLNP in 1992, most likely at this point the Internet would be using larger addresses and would certainly be better off than it is now, but certain very vocal IETF members wanted to invent their own header format. The new header format designed by IETF is known as <span class="docEmphStrong">IPv6</span>, and because they've been designing it for so long, it is unfortunately not at all clear whether the world will ever migrate to IPv6. It would have been much easier to migrate to a larger address format in the early '90s, when the Internet was smaller and people hadn't out of necessity invented all sorts of kludges (like NAT, see&sect;<a class="docLink" href="#ch17lev2sec7">17.2.1</a> <span class="docEmphasis">NAT (Network Address Translation)</span>) to live with a smaller address space. The reason all this is relevant for this book is that you need to understand some of the politics in order to understand the design of IPsec.</p>
<p class="docText">The &quot;v6&quot; in the name &quot;IPv6&quot; comes from the first four bits of an IP header, which is the VERSION NUMBER field, which is set to <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">4</span> for the current version of IP, so IP is sometimes known as <span class="docEmphStrong">IPv4</span>. I<sub>2</sub> bet you'd guess that <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">5</span> would be the next version number after <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">4</span>, but <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">5</span> was already assigned for a little-known and little-used protocol, so the next version of IP needed to be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">6</span>. If you really care about all this, we<sub>1,3</sub> recommend my<sub>2</sub> book <span class="docEmphasis">Interconnections: Bridges, Routers, Switches, and Internetworking Protocols</span>. (I<sub>2</sub> modestly abstain.)</p>
<p class="docText">In order to understand IPsec, you need to understand both the IPv4 and IPv6 formats, and you need to understand some of the politics associated with the design of IPv6 in order to understand things like why there is an AH header and why it looks different than the ESP header.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1678"></a>The IPv6 designers were frustrated that the world didn't immediately deploy IPv6, after they spent 10 years (so far) designing it. Although bigger addresses are good for you, people don't get excited about learning something new and doing radical changes to all their software if things are working. &quot;What would I get for converting to IPv6?&quot; &quot;Bigger addresses.&quot; &quot;What's an address?&quot; You see, it just doesn't motivate people to turn their environment inside out. Especially when you consider the other thing you get by converting to IPv6, which is noninteroperability with the 600 million current Internet nodes.</p>
<p class="docText">So the IPv6 proponents hoped that IPsec (among other features) would be the motivator for moving to IPv6. Some IPv6 advocates proposed making it illegal to make any improvements (including IPsec) to IPv4, so that if the world wanted any of the stuff IETF designed in the last 10 years it would have to move to IPv6. But the IPsec designers were more interested in security, and didn't care whether it was deployed with 4-octet or 16-octet addresses, so they designed it to work with either format. The IPv6 specification says that IPsec is a mandatory feature of IPv6, so sometimes people claim that &quot;Security is built into IPv6, whereas it's an add-on to IPv4.&quot; In reality, the &quot;mandatory-ness&quot; of IPsec with IPv6 is just words on paper. There are implementations of IPv6 without IPsec, and there are implementations of IPv4 with IPsec. And IPsec works just as well with IPv4 as IPv6.</p>
<a name="ch17lev2sec7"></a>
<h4 id="title-IDAH5QRX" class="docSection2Title">17.2.1. NAT (Network Address Translation)</h4>
<p class="docText">Another thing you need to understand is one of the kludges that has allowed the Internet to survive and thrive with 32-bit addresses during the many years in which IPv6 was being designed. The kludge is known as <b><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_135">NAT</a></b>, <span class="docEmphStrong">network address translation</span>. With a NAT box, the computers on your internal network do not need global IPv4 addresses in order to connect to the Internet. Instead the NAT box translates an internal node's IP address into a globally unique address when that node is talking to something on the Internet. NAT complicates everything, especially because many of the higher layer protocols violate layering and carry IP addresses inside their data.</p>
<p class="docText">An IPsec tunnel cannot go through a NAT box because the NAT box wants to update the IP addresses inside the encrypted data and it doesn't have the key. Even IPsec transport mode has problems because the IP address is included in the computation of the TCP or UDP checksumÂthe NAT box cannot correct the checksum because it is encrypted. NAT boxes sometimes make multiple computers appear at the same IP address by assigning each a subset of the TCP and UDP port ranges. This technique also fails with NAT boxes because IPsec encrypts the port information. There are carefully crafted configurations where IPsec can be used through NAT boxes by encapsulating IPsec packets inside UDP packets.</p>
<p class="docText">Absent encryption, NAT boxes are willing to go to extreme lengths to make protocols work. A particularly amusing and nasty example of this is the protocol FTP (File Transfer Protocol, RFC 959). FTP is an application layer protocol, so it is encapsulated within both layer 3 and layer 4. FTP <a name="iddle1376"></a><a name="iddle1383"></a>not only carries IP addresses, but carries them in what is called <span class="docEmphStrong">dotted decimal notation</span>, where each octet of the 4-octet IP address is represented in ASCII as decimal numbers and delimited by periods, e.g., <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">178.201.19.175</span>. Each octet of the IP address might require between one and three ASCII characters (not counting the periods), since leading <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">0</span>s are not transmitted. So the NAT box not only needs to change the IP address in the IP header, but has to know that the packet is FTP, and know to change the address carried inside the FTP data! Worse than that, it might have to replace a string such as <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">178.201.19.175</span> with a string of a different length, such as <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">22.51.111.9</span>. The problem with changing the size of the data is that TCP numbers octets, not packets, so if the NAT box changes the length of one of the packets in a conversation, it has to compensate by changing the TCP sequence numbers for the entire duration of that conversation to compensate!</p>
<p class="docText">So everyone hates NAT, but NAT boxes are very popular because really what users want is for things to work and they don't care about architectural purity. NAT particularly infuriates the IPv6 proponents because it makes it possible for the world to delay migrating to IPv6. The longer the world delays, the harder it will be to get everyone to convert. So the IPv6 proponents actually go out of their way to design things that will not work with NAT, hoping that this will cause the world to abandon NAT (and then, they hope, move to IPv6). That is one reason they like AH, because the AH integrity check will fail if a NAT box modifies the IP header.</p>

<h4 id="title-IDAMBRRX" class="docSection2Title">17.2.2. Firewalls</h4>
<p class="docText">Another important issue is firewalls. Various network administrators like to have firewalls observe packets and discard (<span class="docEmphStrong">filter</span>) packets based on characteristics such as which protocol is being used. Many IETF people hate firewalls, since they tend to make it difficult to deploy new applications, and they break many existing applications. Security is strongest if done end-to-end. IPsec encrypts information on which firewalls like to base decisions, such as the <span class="docEmphSmaller">PORT</span> fields in the TCP header that can help them know whether the data is email or telnet. The people designing the protocols believe such information is nobody's business except the endpoints. Some firewall administrators feel they need that information in order to monitor and control traffic to and from their network.</p>
<p class="docText">Some people hope that IPsec will make firewalls go away, since IPsec encryption will prevent firewalls from being able to do a lot of what people use firewalls for. But more likely, many firewall administrators would rather forgo end-to-end security than give up their ability to monitor and control the traffic between their net and the Internet. If enough firewall administrators decide to throw away any packets that are encrypted because they can't inspect them, people will be highly discouraged from using IPsec. As much as people would like their traffic to be protected in transit, they're even more anxious for their traffic to be delivered at all.</p>
<p class="docText">Some would argue that firewalls exist to compensate for poorly protected, poorly managed end systems on the inside, and that the very existence of IPsec on a system means that that system is well-protected and well-managed. Therefore, they'd argue, it is safe for the firewall to forward <a name="iddle1386"></a>encrypted traffic and assume that an end system smart enough to have IPsec must know what it is doing. That may well be how things initially roll out, but it's unlikely to last. Systems supporting IPsec are not necessarily any better managed than those without it, and sometimes the firewall administrators are trying to prevent anti-social actions like downloading pornography rather than just trying to protect against carelessness.</p>
<p class="docText">One of the most amusing consequences of firewalls is that people find ways of disguising the traffic that firewalls administrators would like to block so that it looks to the firewall like the kind of traffic the firewall is configured to allow. For instance, protocols are being defined to work on top of <span class="docEmphRoman"><a class="docLink" href="app02.html#gloss01_102">HTTP</a></span> to make something like file transfer or system administration look like web browsing. This is extremely inefficient because there are extra layers of protocol. And as a final irony, the term for disguising traffic to look like something the firewall is configured to pass through, when the firewall administrator intends to keep that traffic out, is <span class="docEmphStrong">firewall-friendly</span>.</p>

<p class="docText">For the purposes of this chapter, the most important field is the <span class="docEmphSmaller">PROTOCOL</span> field, which indicates what follows the IP header. Common values are TCP (<span class="docEmphRomanAlt">6</span>), UDP (<span class="docEmphRomanAlt">17</span>), and IP (<span class="docEmphRomanAlt">4</span>). When <span class="docEmphSmaller">PROTOCOL</span> indicates IP, it is a tunneled packet, i.e., following the IP header is another IP header. Note that the <span class="docEmphSmaller">PROTOCOL</span> field value of <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">4</span> for IP has nothing to do with the version number for IPv4; if the next header is IPv6, the protocol field will still be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">4</span>.</p>
<p class="docText"><a name="iddle1485"></a><a name="iddle2085"></a>IPsec defines two new values for the protocol field in the IP header: ESP=<span class="docEmphRomanAlt">50</span> and AH=<span class="docEmphRomanAlt">51</span>. For example, if TCP is on top of IP without IPsec, the <span class="docEmphSmaller">PROTOCOL</span> field in the IP header will be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">6</span>. If TCP is used with IP using AH, for instance, then the <span class="docEmphSmaller">PROTOCOL</span> field in the IP header will equal <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">51</span>, and the <span class="docEmphSmaller">PROTOCOL</span> field in the AH header will be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">6</span> to indicate that TCP follows the AH header. If the packet is encrypted using ESP, then the <span class="docEmphSmaller">PROTOCOL</span> field in the IP header will be <span class="docEmphRomanAlt">50</span>, but the actual <span class="docEmphSmaller">PROTOCOL</span> field, the one that would have appeared in the IP header if encryption with ESP was not being used, will be encrypted, and therefore not visible until the packet is decrypted.</p>
